in a recent issue of critical care , we presented a series of 13 patients undergoing post cardiotomy extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ecmo ) with bivalirudin based anticoagulation. , bivalirudin is rapidly cleaved by proteolytic enzymes , and its half life is about 25 minutes when the renal function is normal. however , it is recommended that , during cpb , blood stagnation in the circuit be avoided because the rapid cleavage of bivalirudin may result in thrombosis. conversely , under some circumstances , the cardiac chambers may act as a ' natural reservoir ' , which entails blood stagnation and the risk for spontaneous intracardiac thrombosis. this is particularly true in the case of a very large right or left atrium with insufficient venous drainage or the case of very poor ventricular systolic function with intraventricular blood stagnation. intracardiac thrombus formation during ecmo with heparin anticoagulation has been described as well , but the pharmacokinetic properties of heparin may limit the risk of thrombus formation due to blood stagnation.
