1 kit and analyzed by using an abi 3100 genetic analyzer ( both from applied biosystems , foster city , ca , usa ) according to the manufacturer 's specifications. two other substitution mutations in the ha1 hemagglutinin , i. both substitutions differ from most influenza a h3n2 field isolates collected in 20032004 , including the fujian and wyoming vaccine strain for 20042005 ( table 2 ). this substitution results in a more accessible receptor binding cleft located directly above residue 145 ( comparing panels a and b ). 8% nucleotide sequence identity and contained the fujian like amino acid substitutions at positions 155 ( h155 t ) and 156 ( q156h ) in the ha protein ( table 2 ). two other substitution mutations in the ha1 hemagglutinin , i. the nepal isolates have drifted from the 20042005 a / fujian/411/03 vaccine strain ( and a / wyoming/03/03 vaccine seed strain ) and are genetically equivalent to a / california/7/04 , the 20052006 northern hemisphere vaccine strain.
