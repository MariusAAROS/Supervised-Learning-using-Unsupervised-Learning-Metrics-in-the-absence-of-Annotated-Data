it is a surgical emergency as joint destruction occurs rapidly and can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. hence , a through clinical and radiological evaluation will help us prognosticate and treat accordingly thereby preventing complications like septic shock , osteomyelitis. mri was obtained [ fig 2 ] which showed extraosseous soft tissue enhancements around left shoulder with soft tissue abscess in inter muscular planes of supraspinatous , infraspinatous , subscapularis. did a retrospective study on 21 patients who underwent surgical treatment for septic arthritis of the shoulder joint between 2000 and 2007 , and he concluded that patients with symptoms for less than 2 weeks did well with arthroscopic approach and early infection can be managed arthroscopically. our reports show that arthroscopic washout can give good result even after 2 weeks of clinical symptoms if there is no evidence of osteomyelitis. patients who are immunocompromised and have insidious onset of moderate to severe pain and which fails to respond to trial of conservative treatment should be subjected to either ultrasound or mri instead of x ray because very often in these group of patients it is primarily a soft tissue pathology like impingement , rc tear , calcific tendinitis or rarely infections and malignancies. we recommend that moderate pain of more than 4 weeks duration with severe stiffness in immunocompromised patient ( liver cirrhosis , renal failure , steroid treatment ) should be further evaluated with mri or ultrasound in the setting of normal x ray and should not be loosely diagnosed as frozen shoulder.
