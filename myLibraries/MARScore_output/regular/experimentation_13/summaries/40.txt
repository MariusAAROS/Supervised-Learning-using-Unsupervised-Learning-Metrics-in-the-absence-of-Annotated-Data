there are many methods for determining the appropriate depth of ett in adults ; fixed insertion depth according to sex ( 23 and 21 cm from the upper incisors in adult males and females , respectively ) , the use of depth marks on the ett , suprasternal palpation of the ett tip or cuff , and bilateral auscultation. the level of carina was defined as the bifurcation of right and left main bronchus and identified by the figure 8 shaped lumen. the ideal position of endotracheal tube ( ett ) to minimize the risk of endobronchial intubation and vocal cord injury. the correlations between age , height , weight , and tracheal length were analyzed using linear regression. demographic data and measured distances between subglottic structures of trachea , external landmarks , and calculated tracheal length. 3 ) mm and ranged from 106. the difference between the extcc ssn and the mid tracheal level was 6.
