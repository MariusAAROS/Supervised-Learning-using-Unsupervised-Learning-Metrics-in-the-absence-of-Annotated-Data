diabetes was induced by multiple low dose of streptozotocin ( mlds ) injection in male c57bl/6 mice. 5 ) and injected intraperitoneally ( ip ) , within 10 min of preparation , at a dose of 40 mg / kg / day for 5 consecutive days. after aseptic removal , spleens were placed in cold hanks solution and teased apart with a pair of forceps and a needle. mouse splenic lymphocytes ( 110cells / ml ) were incubated in the absence or presence of concanavalin a ( 1. 05 ) to evaluate cell function in terms of insulin release , we measured the plasma insulin levels on day 21 ( figure 2 ). 05 ). this model of diabetes offers some advantages , such as simultaneous appearance of diabetes mellitus in all animals and not having immune abnormalities that may complicate studies in spontaneous diabetes in non obese diabetic ( nod ) mice or bio breeding ( bb ) rats.
