[ 45 , 46 ] also modeled the removal of tetrahedra in order to model the action of an ultrasonic aspirator in the context of real time surgery simulation. the preoperative images are updated incrementally. imr images thus have to be rigidly coregistered to take into account this potential rigid motion. then , this resulting surface is deformed using the active surface algorithm as explained above. in contrast , xfem handles a discontinuity by allowing the displacement field to be discontinuous within fes [ 37 , 5860 ]. this volume displacement field is used to warp the part of the 1st imr image corresponding to the whole brain region. the tissue discontinuity due to the 2nd resection is defined from the 4th imr image , and used to appropriately enrich the nodes of the biomechanical model.
