SECTION 1. 2. S. The term `refined petroleum product' means any gasoline, diesel fuel, fuel oil, lubricating oil, liquid petroleum gas, or other petroleum distillate that is produced through the refining or processing of crude oil or an oil derived from tar sands, shale, or coal. The term `refinery' means a facility used in the production of a refined petroleum product through distillation, cracking, or any other process. The owner or operator of a refinery shall submit to the Administrator information describing (1) the schedule of the refinery for any planned refinery outage, including (A) the dates for the planned refinery outage at least 1 year in advance of the date of the expected outage or the date the outage is scheduled; and (B) the estimated inventories and production of refined petroleum products during the period described in subparagraph (A); and (2) any unplanned refinery outages as soon as practicable (c) Review and Analysis of Available Information. (e) Limitation. Nothing in this section (1) alters any existing legal obligation or responsibility of a refinery operator; (2) creates any legal right of action; or (3) authorizes the Secretary (A) to prohibit a refinery operator from conducting a planned refinery outage; or (B) to require a refinery operator to continue to operate a refinery. Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this subsection, the Secretary shall study and submit to Congress a report on the costs and benefits of creating a national strategic refined petroleum products reserve for refined petroleum products. The report required under paragraph (1) shall include information on (A) the days of existing storage capabilities within the different petroleum administration defense districts based on normal usage of refined petroleum products; (B) the feasibility of increasing storage capacity for refined petroleum products on a regional basis; and (C) the impact additional storage capacity would have on the retail price of refined petroleum products for consumers in the event of a supply shortage or market disruption from a natural disaster or refinery outage.SECTION 1. 2.
