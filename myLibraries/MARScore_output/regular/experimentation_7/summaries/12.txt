(2) If the annual removals of individuals of a species or population stock of marine mammals do not exceed the potential biological removal level, the species or population stock will be maintained at, or reach, its optimum sustainable population. (3) Requiring that commercial fishermen achieve a zero mortality rate goal for a species or population stock of marine mammals that is equal to or less than 10 percent of the potential biological removal of a given marine mammal species or population stock is unnecessary to achieve that Act's goal of maintaining species and stocks at their optimum sustainable population and penalizes commercial fishermen. (4) The Congress intended that the zero mortality rate goal under that Act would be met if fishermen use the best technology that is economically and technologically feasible. (5) Species and populations stocks of marine mammal that have reached historic levels are impeding the recovery of endangered species and threatened species through predation or competition in the ecosystem. (7) All persons that interact with marine mammals should seek to reduce and eliminate marine mammal injuries and mortalities through the use of the best equipment and techniques that are economically and technologically feasible. 2.
