SHORT TITLE. 2. (a) Establishment of DSH Redistribution Pool From Unexpended Medicaid DSH Allotments. Such amount shall be determined by the Secretary at the beginning of each fiscal year and the Secretary may adjust such amount in subsequent fiscal years to take into account errors in estimates made for previous fiscal years. The amount in such pool shall be available for obligation and expenditure without fiscal year limitation. At the beginning of each fiscal year (beginning with fiscal year 2010), there shall be added to the DSH redistribution pool an amount equal to the amount by which (i) the total of the DSH allotments for all States for the third preceding fiscal year; exceeded (ii) the total Federal financial participation under this title attributable to such allotments for such fiscal year. At the beginning of each fiscal year (beginning with fiscal year 2011), there shall be subtracted from the DSH redistribution pool an amount equal to the sum of (i) the aggregate increase in Federal financial participation under this title attributable to the amendments made by section 2(b) of the Strengthening the Health Care Safety Net Act of 2009 for the previous fiscal year; and (ii) the amount obligated on grants under subsection (k) for such previous fiscal year. In the case of a State not described in subparagraph (B) in which the total expenditures under the State plan (including Federal and State shares) for disproportionate share hospital adjustments under this section for fiscal year 2005, as reported to the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services as of August 31, 2008, is greater than 0 but less than 3 percent of the State's total amount of expenditures under the State plan for medical assistance during the fiscal year, the DSH allotment for the State with respect to (i) fiscal year 2010 and any succeeding fiscal year before fiscal year 2015 shall be, subject to subparagraph (D), the DSH allotment for the State for the previous fiscal year increased by 16 percent; and (ii) any subsequent fiscal year shall be, subject to subparagraph (D), the DSH allotment for the State for the previous fiscal year subject to an increase for inflation as provided in paragraph (3)(A). Such section is further amended by adding at the end the following new subsection: (k) Demonstration Grants to Health Access Networks. (1) In general. In this subsection, the term `health access network' means an entity representing a collection of safety net providers, including hospitals, community health centers, public health departments, physicians, safety net health plans, federally qualified health centers, or other recognized safety net providers, that (i) is organized for the purpose of restructuring and improving the access, quality, and continuity of care to the uninsured and underinsured; and (ii) offers patients access to all levels of care, including primary, outpatient, specialty, certain ancillary services, and acute inpatient care, within a community or across a broad spectrum of providers across a service region or State. 254b(e)(1)(C)). For purposes of this subparagraph, the term `integrated health care system (including a pediatric system)' means a health care provider that (I) is organized to provide care in a coordinated fashion; and (II) assures access to a full range of primary, specialty, and hospital care, to uninsured and under insured individuals, as appropriate. (3) Application and plan requirement. In order to be eligible for a grant under this subsection, a health access network shall (i) submit an application, in such form and manner as the Secretary shall specify; (ii) submit with such application a plan that meets the requirements of subparagraph (B); (iii) identify in such plan measurable performance targets for at least 3 of the goals described in subparagraph (B); and (iv) agree that a portion of the payment of grant funds for patient care services after the first year for which such payment is made shall be contingent upon the health access network demonstrating success in achieving such targets. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as requiring a health access network operating in a State to operate on a statewide basis or otherwise to serve all uninsured and underinsured individuals in area served. A health access network that receives funds under a grant under this subsection shall expend an amount equal to at least 90 percent of such funds for the provision of (or payment for) direct patient care services. For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term `direct patient care services' means, with respect to a health access network, services, such as specialty medical care and diagnostic services, that are not available or are insufficiently available through the network's providers other than under a grant under this subsection. In purchasing direct patient care services for uninsured and underinsured individuals under a grant under this subsection, health access networks shall, to the maximum extent feasible, endeavor to purchase such services from safety net providers. (5) Supplement, not supplant. Not later than 60 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall develop a unified reporting document for all disproportionate share hospital (DSH) allocations and expenditures under section 1923 of the Social Security Act.SHORT TITLE. 2.
