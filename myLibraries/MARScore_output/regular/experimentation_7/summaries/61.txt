(2) The per diem cost of locking up one young person in a juvenile facility ranges from $24 in Wyoming to $726 in Connecticut, but the American Correctional Association estimates that, on average, it costs States $240. (3) States spend nearly $6,000,000,000 a year incarcerating youth. (4) Youth who are imprisoned are up to 50 percent more likely to recidivate than their counterparts who remain in their communities. (6) The most effective programs at reducing recidivism rates and promoting positive life outcomes for youth are administered within communities, outside of the criminal juvenile justice system. (7) In the United States there are more than 150 service and conservation corps, the direct descendants of the Civilian Conservation Corps of the 1930s, that operate in all 50 States, provide educational and economic opportunities to more than 30,000 young people each year, and make important contributions in the communities in which they are located. (9) Data from 14 original Civic Justice Corps sites demonstrate 80 percent postprogram participant placement rates and 11 percent recidivism rates among program participants (as opposed to the prevailing recidivism rate of 50 to 70 percent). DEFINITIONS. 2801)) and local employers and can provide participants with appropriate postprogram placements; (G) require participants to be enrolled in the program for not less than 6 months, and provide participants with at least 12 months of postprogram support and services; (H) collect postprogram data for at least the 12 months after such participants complete the program; and (I) have in place a plan for sustaining the program after the expiration of the grant. The term local subgrantee refers to a service and conservation corps or other communitybased service organization that (A) has been competitively selected by a national intermediary to carry out a Civic Justice Corps program that implements the Civic Justice Corps Model; and (B) demonstrates (i) a local need for a Civic Justice Corps program; (ii) the ability to recruit and enroll courtinvolved, previously incarcerated, and otherwise disadvantaged youth and young adults between the ages of 16 and 25; (iii) the ability to provide the education, workforce development, service and work experience, and supportive and followup services described in paragraph (1); (iv) relationships with local criminal, juvenile justice, and social service agencies; (v) relationships with local boards (as such term is defined in section 101 of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (29 U. 2801)) and employers and the ability to place participants upon program completion; (vi) the ability to collect data and report on the performance measures described in section 6(b); and (vii) a plan to sustain the Civic Justice Corps program after the expiration of the subgrant. 5. The Attorney General shall award grants to one or more national intermediaries to develop, implement, and collect data from Civic Justice Corps programs administered by no fewer than nine local subgrantees in diverse geographic locations. An entity receiving a subgrant under this section shall use the funds made available through such subgrant to carry out a Civic Justice Corps program that implements the Civic Justice Corps Model. Such program shall include the provision of educational programming and support to participants, which may include (1) basic instruction and remedial education; (2) language instruction for individuals with limited English proficiency; (3) secondary education services and activities, including dropout prevention, tutoring, and other activities; (4) preparation for and access to postsecondary education opportunities, including counseling and assistance with applying for student financial aid; (5) work readiness training, which may include (A) development of basic skills, such as (i) arriving on time to work; (ii) being prepared to work; (iii) working independently; (iv) working with others; (v) working safely; and (vi) demonstrating a commitment to produce high quality work; (B) development of jobspecific occupational skills and onthejob training; and (C) assessment of skills, career counseling, and job search assistance; and (6) development and monitoring of individual education and career plans.
