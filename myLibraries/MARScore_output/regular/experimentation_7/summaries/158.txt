SECTION 1. 2. The Congress finds that (1) the Federal Government has an historic commitment to assisting areas of the Nation in need of developing adequate water supplies, (2) water is becoming increasingly scarce and expensive in many parts of the United States, which is compounded when multiple years of drought occur, (3) in most areas of the United States, farms are overwhelmingly the largest water consumers, and (4) it is in the national interest for farmers to implement water conservation measures which address water conservation needs and for the Federal Government to promote such conservation measures. In the case of an eligible taxpayer, there shall be allowed as a credit against the tax imposed by this chapter for the taxable year an amount equal to 30 percent of the water conservation system expenses paid or incurred by the taxpayer during such year. The term `water conservation system expenses' means expenses for the purchase and installation of a water conservation system but only if (i) the land served by the water is entirely in an area which has been identified, in the taxable year or in any of the 3 preceding taxable years, as an area of (I) extreme drought severity on the Palmer Drought Severity Index published by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or (II) water shortage (due to increasing demands, limited supplies, or limited storage) by the Natural Resources Conservation Service of the Department of Agriculture or the Bureau of Reclamation of the Department of the Interior, (ii) the taxpayer has in effect a water conservation plan which has been reviewed and approved by such Service and Bureau, (iii) such expenses are consistent with such plan, and (iv) there is an irrigation water savings of at least 5 percent which is attributable to such system. The term `water conservation system' means materials or equipment which are primarily designed to substantially conserve irrigation water used or to be used on farm land. The term `farm land' means land used in a trade or business by the taxpayer or a tenant of the taxpayer for (i) the production of crops, fruits, or other agricultural products, (ii) the raising, harvesting, or growing of trees, or (iii) the sustenance of livestock. The credit allowable under subsection (a) for any taxable year shall not exceed the excess (if any) of (A) the regular tax for the taxable year, reduced by the sum of the credits allowable under subpart A and the preceding sections of this subpart, over (B) the tentative minimum tax for the taxable year. The amendments made by this section shall apply to amounts paid or incurred after the date of the enactment of this Act, in taxable years ending after such date.SECTION 1. 2.
