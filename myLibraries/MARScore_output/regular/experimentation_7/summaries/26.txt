2. (2) The Hempstead Plains encompass approximately 950 acres east of Clinton Road and south of Old Country Road in Garden City, New York, and have been called the Cradle of Aviation. (4) During World War I, the airfields of Hempstead Plains were an important training center for United States military pilots, as well as a major hub for military aircraft research, development, and production. This aircraft was built at the Curtiss factory in Garden Citya building which still stands. (7) In 1929, Amelia Earhart and other pioneering women pilots founded the International Organization of Women Pilots, or the NinetyNines, at Curtiss Field. (9) In the 1930s, Roosevelt Field was the busiest civilian airfield in the United States, and played a role in many other historic transcontinental, transatlantic, and recordsetting flights. (11) During World War II, Long Island was a crucial center of military aircraft production. (12) Most notably, the Grumman Aircraft Company, based in Bethpage, New York, and the Republic Aviation Corporation, based in Farmingdale, New York, manufactured innovative planes that proved highly valuable to the U. (15) In 1962, Grumman won the contract to build the Lunar Module as part of the Apollo Program, and in 1969 the first men traveled to the moon aboard a spacecraft built with the expertise of Long Island's aviation industry. The Secretary of the Interior shall conduct a special resource study of the study area. In conducting the study under subsection (a), the Secretary shall (1) evaluate the national significance of the study area based on an assessment of Long Island's aviation history; (2) determine the suitability and feasibility of designating parts of the study area as a unit of the National Park System commemorating Long Island's aviation history; (3) consider other alternatives for preservation, protection, and interpretation of the study area by Federal, State, or local governmental entities, or private and nonprofit organizations; (4) identify properties related to Long Island's aviation history that could meet criteria for listing in the National Register of Historic Places or criteria for designation as National Historic Landmarks; (5) consult with interested Federal, State, or local governmental entities, private and nonprofit organizations, or any other interested individuals; (6) consider the appropriate management options needed to ensure the protection, preservation, and interpretation of the study area; (7) evaluate appropriate ways to enhance historical research, education, interpretation, and public awareness of Long Island's aviation history; and (8) identify cost estimates for any Federal acquisition, development, interpretation, operation, and maintenance associated with the alternatives.2.
