SECTION 1. Congress finds the following: (1) Access to safe, legal abortion services is essential to women's health and central to women's ability to participate equally in the economic and social life of the United States. (2) Access to safe, legal abortion services has been hindered in the United States in various ways, including blockades of health care facilities and associated violence; restrictions on insurance coverage; restrictions on minors' ability to obtain services; and requirements and restrictions that single out abortion providers and those seeking their services, and which do not further women's health or the safety of abortion, but harm women by reducing the availability of services. (3) In the early 1990s, protests and blockades at health care facilities where abortions were performed, and associated violence, increased dramatically and reached crisis level, requiring Congressional action. Congress passed the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act (Public Law 103259) to address that situation and ensure that women could physically access abortion services. (4) Since 2010, there has been an equally dramatic increase in the number of laws and regulations singling out abortion that threaten women's health and their ability to access safe abortion services by interfering with health care professionals' ability to provide such services. In addition, there has been a dramatic increase in the passage of laws that blatantly violate the constitutional protections afforded women, such as bans on abortion prior to viability. (5) Legal abortion is one of the safest medical procedures in the United States. Though described by their proponents as health and safety regulations, many of these abortionspecific restrictions do not advance the safety of abortion services and do nothing to protect women's health. These harms fall especially heavily on lowincome women, women of color, and women living in rural and other medically underserved areas. (9) Congress has the authority to protect women's ability to access abortion services pursuant to its powers under the Commerce Clause and its powers under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution to enforce the provisions of section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment. SEC. 3. The term government includes a branch, department, agency, instrumentality, or individual acting under color of law of the United States, a State, or a subdivision of a State. The term health care professional means a licensed medical professional (including physicians, certified nursemidwives, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants) who is competent to perform abortions based on clinical training. (5) Medically comparable procedures. (6) Pregnancy. The term pregnancy refers to the period of the human reproductive process beginning with the implantation of a fertilized egg. (8) Viability. (6) A requirement that, prior to obtaining an abortion, a patient make one or more medically unnecessary inperson visits to the provider of abortion services or to any individual or entity that does not provide abortion services. (1) In general. To make a prima facie showing that a measure or action is unlawful under paragraph (1) a plaintiff shall demonstrate that the measure or action involved (A) singles out the provision of abortion services or facilities in which abortion services are performed; or (B) impedes women's access to abortion services based on one or more of the factors described in paragraph (3). Factors for a court to consider in determining whether a measure or action impedes access to abortion services for purposes of paragraph (2)(B) include the following: (A) Whether the measure or action interferes with an abortion provider's ability to provide care and render services in accordance with her or his good faith medical judgment. (C) Whether the measure or action is reasonably likely to directly or indirectly increase the cost of providing abortion services or the cost for obtaining abortion services (including costs associated with travel, childcare, or time off work). (D) Whether the measure or action requires, or is reasonably likely to have the effect of necessitating, a trip to the offices of the abortion provider that would not otherwise be required. (E) Whether the measure or action is reasonably likely to result in a decrease in the availability of abortion services in the State. (3) A restriction that limits a pregnant woman's ability to obtain an immediate abortion when a health care professional believes, based on her or his goodfaith medical judgment, that delay would pose a risk to the woman's health. (d) Limitation. (d) Costs. In any action under this section, the court shall award costs of litigation, as well as reasonable attorney fees, to any prevailing plaintiff. If any provision of this Act, or the application of such provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be unconstitutional, the remainder of this Act, or the application of such provision to all other persons or circumstances, shall not be affected thereby.SECTION 1.
