2. Congress finds that (1) the Nation's beaches and coastal recreation waters are valuable public resources used for recreation by millions of people annually; (2) the beaches of coastal States are hosts to many outof State and international visitors; (3) tourism in the coastal zone generates billions of dollars annually; (4) increased population and urbanization of the watershed have contributed to the decline in the environmental quality of coastal waters; (5) pollution in coastal waters is not restricted by State and other political boundaries; (6) coastal States have different methods of testing, and parameters for evaluating, the quality of coastal recreation waters, providing varying degrees of protection to the public; (7) the adoption of consistent criteria by coastal States for monitoring and evaluating the quality of coastal recreation waters, and the posting of signs at beaches notifying the public during periods when the standards are exceeded, would enhance public health and safety; and (8) while the adoption of such criteria will enhance public health and safety, exceedances of such criteria should be addressed (for example, as part of a watershed approach to effectively identify and eliminate sources of pollution). SEC. 3. In this title, the following definitions apply: (1) Coastal recreation waters. The term `coastal recreation waters' means waters adjacent to public beaches of the Great Lakes and other marine coastal waters (including bays, lagoon mouths, and coastal estuaries within the tidal zone) used by the public for swimming, bathing, surfing, or other similar water contact activities. The term `floatable materials' means any foreign matter that may float or remain suspended in the water column and includes plastic, aluminum cans, wood, bottles, paper products, and fishing gear. Within 18 months after the date of enactment of this title, the Administrator shall publish regulations requiring monitoring by States of those coastal recreation waters and beaches open for use by the public for compliance with applicable water quality criteria and protection of public safety. Monitoring requirements established pursuant to this subsection shall specify, at a minimum (1) available monitoring methods to be used by States; (2) the frequency and location of monitoring based on (A) the periods of recreational use of such waters; (B) the extent and degree of use during such periods; and (C) the proximity of coastal recreation waters to known or identified point and nonpoint sources of pollution and in relation to storm events; (3) methods for detecting levels of pathogens that are harmful to human health and for identifying shortterm increases in pathogens that are harmful to human health in coastal recreation waters, including in relation to storm events; and (4) conditions and procedures under which discrete areas of coastal recreation waters may be exempted by the Administrator from the monitoring requirements of this subsection, if the Administrator determines that an exemption will not impair compliance with the applicable water quality criteria for those waters and protection of public safety. Regulations published pursuant to subsection (a) shall require States to provide prompt notification to local governments, the public, and the Administrator of an exceedance of applicable water quality criteria for State coastal recreation waters or the immediate likelihood of such an exceedance. Not later than 18 months after the date of the enactment of this title, the Administrator shall issue guidance establishing core performance measures for testing, monitoring, and notification programs and the delegation of such programs under this section to local government authorities. In the case that such responsibilities are delegated by a State to a local government authority, or have been delegated to a local government authority before such date of enactment, in a manner that, at a minimum, is consistent with the guidance issued by the Administrator, State resources, including grants made under section 706, shall be made available to the delegated authority for the purpose of program implementation. The Administrator shall provide technical assistance to States for the implementation of uniform assessment and monitoring procedures for floatable materials in coastal recreation waters and specify the conditions under which the presence of floatable material will constitute a threat to public health and safety. The Administrator shall establish, maintain, and make available to the public by electronic and other means (1) a national coastal recreation water pollution occurrence database, using reliable information, including that reported under subsection (b); and (2) a listing of those communities complying with the regulations issued under subsections (a) and (b). Not later than 4 years after the date of the enactment of this title, and periodically thereafter, the Administrator shall submit to Congress a report including (1) recommendations concerning the need for additional water quality criteria and other actions needed to improve the quality of coastal recreation waters; and (2) an evaluation of State efforts to implement this title. After the last day of the 3\1/2\year period beginning on the date of the enactment of this title, the Administrator may make a grant to a State under this section only if the State demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Administrator that it is implementing its monitoring and notification program under section 704.2. Congress finds that (1) the Nation's beaches and coastal recreation waters are valuable public resources used for recreation by millions of people annually; (2) the beaches of coastal States are hosts to many outof State and international visitors; (3) tourism in the coastal zone generates billions of dollars annually; (4) increased population and urbanization of the watershed have contributed to the decline in the environmental quality of coastal waters; (5) pollution in coastal waters is not restricted by State and other political boundaries; (6) coastal States have different methods of testing, and parameters for evaluating, the quality of coastal recreation waters, providing varying degrees of protection to the public; (7) the adoption of consistent criteria by coastal States for monitoring and evaluating the quality of coastal recreation waters, and the posting of signs at beaches notifying the public during periods when the standards are exceeded, would enhance public health and safety; and (8) while the adoption of such criteria will enhance public health and safety, exceedances of such criteria should be addressed (for example, as part of a watershed approach to effectively identify and eliminate sources of pollution).
