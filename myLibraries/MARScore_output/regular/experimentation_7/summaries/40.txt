SECTION 1. 2. The Congress finds as follows: (1) DiamondBlackfan anemia is a rare genetic bone marrow failure disorder, which develops in infancy and results in severe anemia due to failure to make red blood cells. (2) DiamondBlackfan anemia patients have an increased risk of leukemia, solid tumors, and complete bone marrow failure. (3) Fifty percent of patients with DiamondBlackfan anemia are born with birth defects, including abnormalities to the face, head, upper arm and hand, genitourinary, and heart, and 21 percent of the affected patients have more than 1 defect. (4) Treatments for DiamondBlackfan anemia, including the use of blood transfusions and steroids such as prednisone, have potential longterm side effects, including osteoporosis, iron overload (because of the transfusions), and impaired growth (because of the steroids). (5) The only cure for DiamondBlackfan anemia is a bone marrow transplant, a procedure that carries serious risks and, since most patients lack an acceptable donor, is an option for only about 25 percent of patients. (6) Because DiamondBlackfan anemia is a genetic disorder of red cell production and a cancer predisposition syndrome with a high rate of congenital anomalies, the Federal investment regarding DiamondBlackfan anemia must be expanded to allow the careful dissection of this disease, which will provide valuable insights into the biology of blood disorders and cancer predisposition and serve as an important model for understanding the genetics of birth defects. SEC. S. The Director of NIH, in coordination with the Directors of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, and the Office of Rare Diseases, shall expand and intensify research and related activities of the National Institutes of Health with regard to DiamondBlackfan anemia. The initiative supported under this subsection may include research on the following: (A) The links of DiamondBlackfan anemia to chronic diseases. (E) Congenital anomalies in DiamondBlackfan anemia patients. ) is amended (1) by moving section 317R so that it follows section 317Q; and (2) by inserting after section 317R the following: SEC.
