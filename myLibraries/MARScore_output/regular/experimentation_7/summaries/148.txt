Congress finds that (1) rape and sexual assaults continue to be serious threats to the safety of communities across America; (2) sexual offenders are much more likely than any other category of criminals to repeat their crimes again and again, even after serving time in prison; (3) the average rape sentence is just 10\1/2\ years, and the average time served is half of that, approximately 5 years; and (4) repeat sexual offenders frequently strike in more than one State and, while States have primary responsibility for the prosecution of sexual offenders, the option of Federal prosecution provides a needed additional tool to safeguard communities victimized by these individuals. It is the sense of Congress that (1) States should more seriously consider the relatively high recidivism rate of sexual offenders when deciding whether to plea bargain with a firsttime sexual offender and whether to grant parole to sexual offenders; and (2) States should review their treatment and parole supervision programs for sexual offenders to assure that these programs are fulfilling their goals, and, if they are not, these programs should be immediately replaced or abandoned. Section 2241 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following: (e) Punishment for Sexual Predators. (2) The circumstance referred to in paragraph (1) of this subsection is that the defendant has previously been convicted of another State or Federal offense for conduct which (A) is an offense under this section or section 2242 of this title; or (B) would have been an offense under either of such sections if the offense had occurred in the special maritime or territorial jurisdiction of the United States.
