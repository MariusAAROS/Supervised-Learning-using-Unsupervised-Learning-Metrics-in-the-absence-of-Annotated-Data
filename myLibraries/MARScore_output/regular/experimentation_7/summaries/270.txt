2. ELIMINATION OF EXCESSIVE OIL SPECULATION. Congress finds that (1) the national average retail price for a gallon of gasoline was $3. 75 on June 8, 2011; (2) increased gasoline prices are causing severe economic pain to the American people; (3) Congress has a responsibility (A) to ensure that gasoline prices at the pump reflect the fundamentals of supply and demand; and (B) to bring needed relief to consumers and businesses of the United States at the gas pump; (4) there is mounting evidence that the spike in gasoline prices has (A) little to do with the fundamentals of supply and demand; and (B) more to do with Wall Street speculators increasing oil and gas prices in the energy futures and swaps markets; (5) as of May 27, 2011 (A) the supply of gasoline in the United States was higher than it was 2 years ago; and (B) the demand for gasoline was lower than it was 2 years ago when the national average for a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline was $2. In this Act: (A) Bonafide hedge trading; bonafide hedge transaction. 2) or any other provision of law (including regulations), not later than 14 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Chairman of the Commission shall unilaterally (A) establish 1 or more speculative position limits in any registered entity on or through which crude oil, gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, or heating oil futures or swaps are traded that are equal to the position accountability levels or position limits, as appropriate, established by the New York Mercantile Exchange; (B) establish 1 or more speculative position limits that are equal to the position accountability levels or position limits, as appropriate, established by the New York Mercantile Exchange on the aggregate number or amount of positions in contracts based upon the same underlying commodity that may be held by any person, including any group or class of traders, for each month across (i) contracts listed by designated contract markets; (ii) with respect to an agreement, contract, or transaction that settles against any price (including the daily or final settlement price) of 1 or more contracts listed for trading on a registered entity, contracts traded on a foreign board of trade that provides members or other participants located in the United States with direct access to the electronic trading and order matching system of the foreign board of trade; and (iii) swap contracts that perform or affect a significant price discovery function with respect to regulated entities; (C) establish margin requirements of 12 percent for speculative swaps and futures trading in crude oil, gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, and heating oil; (D) require that each bank holding company, investment bank, hedge fund, or swaps dealer engaged in the trading of energy futures or swaps for the benefit of the bank holding company, investment bank, hedge fund, or swaps dealer or on the behalf of, or as counterparty to, an index fund, exchange traded fund, or other noncommercial participant (i) register with the Commission as a noncommercial participant; and (ii) be subject to each position limit and margin requirement under this subsection for each position in a manner by which the position is considered to be a speculative, proprietary position of the bank holding company, investment bank, hedge fund, or swaps dealer; (E) take any other action that the Chairman of the Commission determines to be necessary to eliminate excessive speculation in the aggregate to ensure that the price of crude oil, gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, and heating oil accurately reflects the fundamentals of supply and demand; and (F) ensure that each bank holding company, hedge fund, investment bank, and swaps dealer that is engaged in the trading of energy futures or swaps for the benefit of the bank holding company, hedge fund, investment bank, and swaps dealer, or on the behalf of, or as counterparty to, 1 or more noncommercial participants, abides by each position limit and margin requirement under this subsection. It is the sense of Congress that, if finalized, the proposed position limits for derivatives that the Commission included in the notice of proposed rulemaking entitled Position Limits for Derivatives (76 Fed. 4752 (January 26, 2011)) are not sufficient to fulfill the statutory requirements of title VII of the DoddFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (15 U. ) (and amendments made by that Act) to diminish, eliminate, or prevent excessive speculation.
