SEC. S. The term `advanced service' means a communications service or combination of such services providing a digitally encoded signal downstream from a provider to a consumer at a rated speed of 200 kilobits per second or above and upstream from a consumer to a provider at a rated speed of 128 kilobits per second or above for access to the Internet or other interstate information and data services. Nothwithstanding section 2(b) of this Act, or any other provision of law, an incumbent local exchange carrier shall not be subject to the requirements of (1) section 251(c)(3) with respect to facilities and equipment used exclusively to provide advanced service; and (2) section 251(c)(4) for the provision of advanced service, in any State in which 70 percent of the incumbent local exchange carrier's loops in its service territory are DSLcapable, as determined by that State. If the Commission determines under paragraph (1) that advanced service is being offered by an unaffiliated provider in the manner described in that paragraph, the Commission shall approve the petition of the incumbent local exchange carrier unconditionally. The rates, terms, and conditions of advanced service offered by an incumbent local exchange carrier or its affiliate are not subject to regulation in any geographic area in which that carrier, its successor, or assigns was not the local incumbent exchange carrier on February 8, 1996. Any such schedule of charges and practices shall be deemed lawful and shall be effective 2 days after the date on which it was filed with the Commission unless the Commission takes action under section 204(a)(1) before the end of that 2 day period.
