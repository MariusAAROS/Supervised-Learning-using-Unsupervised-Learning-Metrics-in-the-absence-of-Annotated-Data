2. Congress finds that (1) it is becoming more common for corporations that file for bankruptcy protection under chapter 11 of title 11, United States Code, to ask for great sacrifices from workers, retirees, creditors, and former shareholders, while executives provide themselves with generous bonuses and other forms of lucrative compensation; (2) in the case of one company, an executive pay package for key employees would have given executives and managers $510,000,000 in compensation, while rankandfile workers were asked to take large wage cuts or forced to lose their jobs; (3) decency requires that the highly paid not seek to enrich themselves on the backs of working families; (4) some bankruptcies involve companies with both foreign and domestic operations, and judges need to be able to evaluate the entirety of the operations when deciding whether sacrifices by American workers and retirees are necessary; and (5) there is a need for fairness and accountability and a new partnership for the future of the American workforce. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION. Section 1113(d) of title 11, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following: (4) Foreign Affiliates. In determining whether the proposal required by subsection (f)(1)(A) provides for those necessary modifications in retiree benefits that are necessary to permit the reorganization of the debtor and assures that all creditors, the debtor, and all affected parties are treated fairly and equitably, the court shall take into account the ongoing impact on the debtor of the debtor's relationship with all subsidiaries and affiliates, regardless of whether any such subsidiary or affiliate is domestic or nondomestic, or whether any such subsidiary or affiliate is a debtor entity.2.
