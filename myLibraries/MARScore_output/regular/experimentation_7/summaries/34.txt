SECTION 1. 2. Congress finds that in order to prevent the creation of a cloned human individual through human somatic cell nuclear transfer technology, it is right and proper to prohibit the creation of cloned human embryos that would never have the opportunity for implantation and that would therefore be created solely for research that would ultimately lead to their destruction. Prohibition on cloning. (c) Penalties. (1) In general. Any person or entity who is convicted of violating any provision of this section shall be subject to, in the case of a violation that involves the derivation of a pecuniary gain, a civil penalty of not more than an amount equal to the amount of the gross gain multiplied by 2. The term `human somatic cell nuclear transfer technology' means taking the nuclear material of a human somatic cell and incorporating it into an oocyte from which the nucleus has been removed or rendered inert and producing an embryo (including a preimplantation embryo). 301.
