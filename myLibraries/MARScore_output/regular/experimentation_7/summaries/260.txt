Congress finds that (1) North American demand for natural gas is expected to increase dramatically over the course of the next several decades, as described in section 114 of the Alaska Natural Gas Pipeline Act of 2004 (15 U. 720l); (2) although North American natural gas supplies are adequate to meet customer needs in calendar years 2011 and 2012 and for the near future, the availability of Alaska gas as an additional domestic source would further shield the United States from any future reliance on overseas energy supplies in the years ahead; (3) 2 military installations in the Fairbanks North Star Borough, Alaska, Fort Wainwright and Eielson Air Force Base (A) are a central component of the ability of the United States to project power over a vast area of the Pacific region; (B) are home to approximately 23,000 military members and families; (C) are located along or relatively adjacent to any costeffective Alaska natural gas pipeline project corridor; and (D) would benefit from access to affordable natural gas supplies drawn from the proposed Alaska natural gas pipeline project, freeing up funding for pursuing mid term and longterm renewable energy goals; (4) the Fairbanks North Star Borough (A) suffers from a thermal inversion that traps particulate emissions and other air pollutants; and (B) has been declared a nonattainment zone for failing to achieve reductions in particulate matter by the Environmental Protection Agency; (5) the availability of affordable cleanburning natural gas would significantly improve air quality in the public health interest of Borough residents; (6) the most logical route for an Alaska natural gas transportation project (as defined in section 102 of the Alaska Natural Gas Pipeline Act of 2004 (15 U. DEFINITION OF ALASKA NATURAL GAS TRANSPORTATION PROJECT. Section 102 of the Alaska Natural Gas Pipeline Act of 2004 (15 U. ), regardless of whether the segment (i) is proposed and constructed prior to the construction of the entire system described in subparagraph (A); or (ii) initially transports Alaska natural gas solely for delivery to consumers within the State of Alaska.
