The Director of NIH, in coordination with the Directors of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, and such other Institutes and Centers as specified by the Director shall provide for the upgrading and unification of spinal muscular atrophy clinical trial sites and the recruitment of new investigators and sites to establish a national clinical trials network for spinal muscular atrophy. The Director of NIH shall ensure that such network (1) conducts coordinated, multisite, clinical trials of therapies and clinical approaches to the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy; and (2) rapidly and efficiently disseminates scientific findings to the field. The Director of NIH, in coordination with the Commissioner of Food and Drugs and the Directors of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, and such other Institutes and Centers as specified by the Director, shall establish a data coordinating center with respect to spinal muscular atrophy to (1) provide expert assistance in the design, conduct, data analysis, data management, and data warehousing of collaborative clinical and descriptive research projects; (2) organize and conduct multisite monitoring activities; (3) provide regular reports to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, such other Institutes and Centers as specified by the Director, and the Food and Drug Administration on enrollment and the allocation of resources; and (4) conduct such other activities as are deemed necessary by the Secretary. (a) In General. (a) Establishment. Not later than 6 months after the date of the enactment of this section, the Secretary shall establish a committee, to be known as the Interagency Spinal Muscular Atrophy Research Coordinating Committee (in this section referred to as the `Committee'). The Committee shall (1) share and coordinate information on existing research activities, and make recommendations to the National Institutes of Health and other Federal agencies regarding how to improve existing research programs, that are related to spinal muscular atrophy research and other related neurological diseases and disorders; (2) develop a comprehensive strategy related to spinal muscular atrophy research and other related neurological diseases and disorders and advise the National Institutes of Health and other Federal agencies, expanding proposals for collaborative, multidisciplinary research, including proposals for Common Fund research described in section 402(b)(7) and other proposals that involve collaboration between 2 or more national research institutes or national centers; (3) provide annual reports to the Secretary regarding the National Institutes of Health and other Federal agencies' collaborative multidisciplinary research efforts to support spinal muscular atrophy, including the Spinal Muscular Atrophy Project at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, the ongoing and future research needs to advance therapies for spinal muscular atrophy, and recommendations on how to strengthen the collaboration of research activities by the institutes and agencies to improve the results; (4) develop a summary of advances in research related to spinal muscular atrophy research and other related neurological diseases and disorders research supported or conducted by Federal agencies; and (5) not later than 1 year after the date of the establishment of the Committee, make recommendations to the Secretary (A) regarding any appropriate changes to research activities, including recommendations to improve the research portfolio of the National Institutes of Health to ensure that scientificallybased strategic planning is implemented in support of research priorities that impact research activities related to spinal muscular atrophy and other related neurological diseases and disorders; (B) identifying barriers to the development of new treatments and cures for spinal muscular atrophy and other related neurological diseases and disorders; (C) regarding public participation in decisions relating to spinal muscular atrophy research and other related neurological diseases and disorders to increase the involvement of patient advocacy and community organizations representing a broad geographical area; (D) on how best to disseminate information on spinal muscular atrophy progress; and (E) on how to expand partnerships between public entities, including Federal agencies, and private entities to expand collaborative, crosscutting research. (B) 3 members shall be appointed from members of the general public, who represent individuals with spinal muscular atrophy.
