SECTION 1. SEC. DOMESTIC ENERGY SELFSUFFICIENCY PLAN. The Secretary of Energy shall develop, and transmit to the Congress within 1 year after the date of the enactment of this Act, a strategic plan to ensure that the United States is energy selfsufficient by the year 2010. The plan shall include recommendations for legislative and regulatory actions needed to accomplish that goal. There are authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary of Energy $20,000,000 for carrying out this section. (a) Program. The Secretary of Energy shall establish a program for the acquisition of (1) up to 100 commercially available 200 kilowatt fuel cell power plants; (2) up to 20 megawatts of power generated from commercially available fuel cell power plants; or (3) a combination thereof, for use at federally owned or operated facilities. The Secretary shall provide funding for purchase, site engineering, installation, startup, training, operation, and maintenance costs associated with the acquisition of such power plants, along with any other necessary assistance. All fuel cell systems and fuel cell stacks in power plants acquired, or from which power is acquired, under subsection (a) shall be assembled in the United States. In the selection of federally owned or operated facilities as a site for the location of power plants acquired under this section, or as a site to receive power acquired under this section, priority shall be given to sites with 1 or more of the following attributes: (1) Location (of the Federal facility or the generating power plant) in an area classified as a nonattainment area under title I of the Clean Air Act. There are authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary of Energy $140,000,000 for the period encompassing fiscal years 2001 through 2003 for carrying out this section. (C) Demonstration of use of hydrogen as a practical, safe, renewable energy source in a highly efficient, zeroemission power system for buses. (D) Development of a hydrogen proton exchange membrane fuel cell power system that is confirmed and verified as being compatible with transit bus application requirements. (E) Durability testing of the fuel cell bus at a national testing facility. Any lifecycle cost benefit analysis undertaken by a Federal agency with respect to investments in products, services, construction, and other projects shall include an analysis of environmental and power reliability factors. (a) Grant Program. The Secretary of Energy shall establish a program for making grants to State or local governments for the use of fuel cell technology in meeting their energy requirements, including the use as a source of power for motor vehicles.SECTION 1.
