SEC. 2. Congress finds the following: (1) The industrialization of China and India has driven demand for nonfuel mineral commodities, sparking a period of resource nationalism exemplified by China's reduction in exports of rareearth elements necessary for telecommunications, military technologies, healthcare technologies, and conventional and renewable energy technologies. (3) The exploration, production, processing, use, and recycling of minerals contribute significantly to the economic wellbeing, security and general welfare of the Nation. (4) The United States has vast mineral resources, but is becoming increasingly dependent upon foreign sources of these mineral materials, as demonstrated by the following: (A) Twentyfive years ago the United States was dependent on foreign sources for 30 nonfuel mineral materials, 6 of which the United States imported 100 percent of the Nation's requirements, and for another 16 commodities the United States imported more than 60 percent of the Nation's needs. (C) The United States share of world wide mineral exploration dollars was 8 percent in 2011, down from 19 percent in the early 1990s. (D) In the 2012 Ranking of Countries for Mining Investment, out of 25 major mining countries, the United States ranked last with Papua New Guinea in permitting delays, and towards the bottom regarding government take and social issues affecting mining. SEC. In this Act: (1) Strategic and critical minerals. The term strategic and critical minerals means minerals that are necessary (A) for national defense and national security requirements; (B) for the Nation's energy infrastructure, including pipelines, refining capacity, electrical power generation and transmission, and renewable energy production; (C) to support domestic manufacturing, agriculture, housing, telecommunications, healthcare, and transportation infrastructure; and (D) for the Nation's economic security and balance of trade. The term agency means any agency, department, or other unit of Federal, State, local, or tribal government, or Alaska Native Corporation. 101. Domestic mines that will provide strategic and critical minerals shall be considered an infrastructure project as described in Presidential Order Improving Performance of Federal Permitting and Review of Infrastructure Projects dated March 22, 2012. (c) The lead agency with responsibility for issuing a mineral exploration or mine permit shall enhance government coordination on permitting and review by avoiding duplicative reviews, minimizing paperwork and engaging other agencies and stakeholders early in the process. (2) Conducting reviews concurrently rather than sequentially to the extent practicable and when such concurrent review will expedite rather than delay a decision. (d) At the request of a project proponent, the project lead of the agency with responsibility for issuing a mineral exploration or mine permit shall enter into an agreement with the project proponent and other cooperating agencies that sets time limits for each part of the permit review process including the following: (1) The decision on whether to prepare a document required under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. (3) The scope of and schedule for the baseline studies required to prepare a document required under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. The lead agency shall begin implementing this section with respect to such application within 30 days after receiving such written request. FEDERAL REGISTER PROCESS FOR MINERAL EXPLORATION AND MINING PROJECTS. The court shall endeavor to hear and determine any covered civil action as expeditiously as possible. Sections 504 of title 5, United States Code, and 2412 of title 28, United States Code (together commonly called the Equal Access to Justice Act) do not apply to a covered civil action, nor shall any party in such a covered civil action receive payment from the Federal Government for their attorneys' fees, expenses, and other court costs.SEC. 2.
