2. Beginning in fiscal year 2010, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall make grants to water systems to assist in planning, designing, constructing, implementing, or maintaining any program, strategy, or infrastructure improvement (1) to conserve water or increase water use efficiency; (2) to carry out water metering to measure water efficiency effectiveness of a water efficiency program; (3) to preserve or improve water quality; (4) to enhance water management by increasing source water preservation and protection, or natural or engineered green infrastructure in the management, conveyance, or treatment of water, wastewater, or stormwater; (5) to increase energy efficiency or the use and generation of renewable energy in the management, conveyance, or treatment of water, wastewater, or stormwater; (6) to support the adoption and use of advanced water treatment, water supply management, or water demand management technologies or processes (such as those used in water reuse and recycling or adaptive conservation pricing) that maintain or increase water supply or improve water quality; (7) to complete studies or assessments to project how climate change may impact the future operations and sustainability of the water system; or (8) to carry out any other activity or project to address any ongoing or forecasted, based on the best available research and data, climaterelated impact on the water quality or quantity of a region of the United States that increases the resiliency of a water system to the impacts of climate change. To be eligible to receive a grant from the Administrator under subsection (a), the owner or operator of a water system shall (1) submit to the Administrator an application that includes a proposal of the program, strategy, or infrastructure improvement to be planned, designed, constructed, implemented, or maintained by the water system; (2) cite the best available research or data that describes (A) the risk to the system's water resources or infrastructure as a result of ongoing or forecasted changes to the hydrological system brought about by factors arising from global climate change; and (B) how the proposed program, strategy, or infrastructure improvement would perform under the anticipated climate conditions; (3) explain how the proposed program, strategy, or infrastructure improvement is expected to increase the water system's resiliency to these risks or reduce the water system's direct or indirect greenhouse gas emissions; and (4) demonstrate the consistency of the program, strategy, or infrastructure improvement with an applicable climate adaptation plan completed and adopted by a State. (d) Cost Sharing. (g) Definitions. (2) The term water system means a community water system as defined in section 1401 of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U. To carry out this section, there are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary.
