SEC. 2. (a) Application to Medicaid. A State child health plan shall provide that in the case of any child who becomes an inmate of a public institution and who is still a child at the time of release from such institution, if the child was enrolled for child health assistance under the State child health plan immediately before becoming such an inmate the State must suspend, rather than terminate, such enrollment for such child during the period in which such child is such an inmate in a manner such that (i) the enrollment of such child shall be reinstated upon release from such institution unless and until there is a determination that the child is no longer eligible to be so enrolled; and (ii) any period of continuous eligibility in effect on the date the child became such an inmate shall be reinstated as of the date of the release and the duration of such period shall be determined without regard to the period in which the child was such an inmate. Subject to paragraph (2), the amendments made by this section shall apply to individuals who become inmates of a public institution on or after January 1, 2009. (2) Exception if state legislation required. For purposes of the previous sentence, in the case of a State that has a 2year legislative session, each year of such session shall be deemed to be a separate regular session of the State legislature.
