SECTION 1. Congress finds the following: (1) Low income people are subject to many taxes, including the Federal income tax, payroll taxes, and State income taxes. In addition, eligibility for many Federal and State programs for assistance to the working poor, such as the earned income tax credit, food stamps, housing assistance programs, medicaid, child care assistance, and the women, infants, and children (WIC) nutrition program is based in part on income levels. The rates at which the benefits from such programs are phased out have the same effect as additional taxes imposed on the beneficiaries. (2) The total effective marginal rate of tax for additional income earned by low income people can exceed 100 percent and can be a disincentive to working more hours, getting a raise, learning a more lucrative trade, getting married, or engaging in other economic or social activities. (a) Establishment. There is established a commission to be known as the National Commission on Marginal Tax Rates for the Working Poor (in this section referred to as the Commission).

At least half of the members appointed by each person who appoints members under paragraph (1) shall be recognized experts from think tanks or academia in the subject matter reviewed by the Commission. The Chairman shall appoint an executive director of the Commission. The executive director shall be paid the rate of basic pay for level V of the Executive Schedule. The staff of the Commission shall be appointed without regard to the provisions of title 5, United States Code, governing appointments in the competitive service, and shall be paid without regard to the provisions of chapter 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53 of such title (relating to classification and General Schedule pay rates). Upon the request of the Commission, the Comptroller General shall conduct such studies or investigations as the Commission determines to be necessary to carry out its duties. (5) Use of mails. The Commission may secure directly from any Federal agency information necessary to enable it to carry out its duties, if the information may be disclosed under section 552 of title 5, United States Code. Not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Commission shall submit to Congress a report containing (1) the Commission's findings; and (2) recommendations for resolving any economic and other disincentives found by the Commission caused by the marginal tax rates to which the working poor are subject.
