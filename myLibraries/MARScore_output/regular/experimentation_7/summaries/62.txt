The final rule promulgated under paragraph (1) shall (A) require special packaging for liquid detergent packets; (B) include standards to address the design and color of liquid detergent packets to (i) make them less attractive to children; (ii) reduce the likelihood of exposure to detergent; and (iii) otherwise reduce risks related to the ingestion or aspiration of, or ocular contact with, detergent and other potential injury risks of liquid detergent packets; (C) include standards to address the composition of liquid detergent packets to make the consequences of exposure less severe; and (D) prescribe warning labels that (i) adequately inform consumers of the potential risks of injury and death caused by liquid detergent packets; (ii) are conspicuous and visible at the point of sale; (iii) clarify hazard patterns, including known consequences of such hazards; and (iv) identify actions needed to avoid injury. (B) Inapplicability of certain requirements. Subsection (b)(1) shall not apply if the Commission determines that (A) a voluntary standard pertaining to liquid detergent packets manufactured or imported for use in the United States protects children as described in subsection (b)(1); (B) such voluntary standard is or will be in effect not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of this Act; and (C) such voluntary standard is developed by ASTM International Subcommittee F15. If the Commission determines that a voluntary standard meets the conditions in paragraph (1), such standard shall be treated as a consumer product safety standard described in section 7(a) of the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U. 2056(a)) beginning on the date that is the later of (A) the date that is 180 days after the date of the publication under paragraph (2) of such determination; or (B) the effective date specified in the voluntary standard. (A) Notice of revision. The report required by paragraph (1) shall include the following: (A) A quantitative assessment of annual national pediatric exposure to detergent packets, including the number of exposure incidents, the means of exposure (whether by ingestion, aspiration, or ocular contact), the clinical effects of the exposures, and medical outcomes. (B) An assessment as to whether the rule promulgated under subsection (b)(1) or the voluntary standard adopted under subsection (c), as the case may be, has been effective in protecting young children from injury or illness caused by exposure to detergent packets.SECTION 1.
