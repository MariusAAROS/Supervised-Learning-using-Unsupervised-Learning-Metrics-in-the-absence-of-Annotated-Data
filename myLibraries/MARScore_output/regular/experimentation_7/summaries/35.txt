The Department of Transportation has promulgated the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations to further this purpose. Motor carriers do not, however, possess the requisite level of control or authority over this intermodal equipment to perform the systematic maintenance, repair and inspection necessary to ensure compliance with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations and to ensure the safety of our Nation's highways. Additionally, violations of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations attributable to intermodal equipment are assigned to the motor carrier's safety record. Congress should exercise its power to ensure that only those parties who control the equipment, thus having the opportunity and authority to systematically maintain, repair and inspect intermodal equipment, assume responsibility for the safety of that equipment as it travels in interstate commerce. 3.
