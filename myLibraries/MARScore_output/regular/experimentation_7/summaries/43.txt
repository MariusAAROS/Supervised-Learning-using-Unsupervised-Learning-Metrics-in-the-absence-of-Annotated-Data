SECTION 1. Congress makes the following findings: (1) Promoting safety on United States highways is a national priority. The Secretary of Transportation has promulgated the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations to further this purpose. (2) Intermodal transportation plays a significant role in expanding the United States economy, which depends heavily upon the ability to transport goods by various modes of transportation. (3) Although motor carriers and their drivers often receive trailers, chassis, containers, and other items of intermodal equipment to be transported in interstate commerce, they do not possess the requisite level of control or authority over this intermodal equipment to perform the systematic maintenance, repair, and inspection necessary to ensure compliance with the applicable Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations and to ensure the safety of United States highways. These violations negatively affect the safety records of motor carriers. 3. (11) `equipment interchange agreement', with respect to intermodal equipment, means a written document that (A) is executed by a controller of the equipment, or its agent, and a motor carrier; and (B) establishes the responsibilities and liabilities of both parties as they relate to the interchange of the equipment. (12) `controller', with respect to intermodal equipment, means any party that has any legal right, title, or interest in the equipment, except that a motor carrier (A) is not a controller of the equipment solely because it provides or arranges for any part of the intermodal transportation of the equipment; and (B) may not be considered a controller of the equipment if authority for systematic maintenance and repairs of the equipment has not been delegated to the motor carrier. (13) `interchange', with respect to intermodal equipment, means the act of providing the equipment to a motor carrier for the purpose of transporting the equipment for loading or unloading by any party or repositioning the equipment for the benefit of the equipment controller, except that such term does not mean the leasing of the equipment to a motor carrier for use in the motor carrier's overtheroad freight hauling operations. Chapter 59 of title 49, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new section: Sec. (a) In General. (1) In general. In the event that a repair of interchanged intermodal equipment is necessary while in a motor carrier's possession in order to comply with applicable safety regulations, the controller of the equipment shall promptly reimburse the motor carrier for the actual expenses that are incurred by the motor carrier for the necessary repair, together with compensation for any loss incurred by the motor carrier by reason of delay in the transportation of the equipment necessitated by the need for the repair. No record or report of a violation of applicable safety regulations attributable to interchanged intermodal equipment, whether issued by a Federal, State, or local law enforcement authority, shall have any effect on a motor carrier's overall safety rating or safety status measurement system score, as determined by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, or on a driving record of a driver for the motor carrier unless such violation was proximately caused by the negligence or willful misconduct of the motor carrier or driver, respectively. The Secretary shall establish and implement with appropriate staffing an inspection and audit program at facilities of controllers of intermodal equipment in order to make determinations under subsection (a). Upon receiving a motor carrier's request for maintenance or repair of intermodal equipment to be picked up by the motor carrier in an interchange of equipment, the controller of intermodal equipment shall be considered to have retaliated against the motor carrier for the purposes of this section if the controller of intermodal equipment fails to provide the motor carrier with the equipment in a condition compliant with the applicable safety regulations within 60 minutes after the motor carrier arrives to pick up the equipment at the place where the equipment is to be picked up. A controller of intermodal equipment that violates subsection (a) shall be liable to the United States Government for a civil penalty of up to $10,000 for each violation. 10. COMPATIBILITY OF STATE LAWS. Chapter 59 of title 49, United States Code, as amended by section 10, is further amended by adding at the end the following new section: Sec. Except as provided in subsection (b) or as otherwise authorized by Federal law, a law, regulation, order, or other requirement of a State or political subdivision of a State, or of a tribal organization, is preempted if compliance with such law, regulation, order, or other requirement would preclude compliance with a requirement imposed under this chapter. In this section, the term `tribal organization' has the meaning given such term in section (4)(l) of the Indian SelfDetermination and Education Assistance Act (25 U. C. The table of sections at the beginning of such chapter is amended (1) by striking the item relating to section 5907; and (2) by adding at the end the following: 5909. Compatibility of State laws. The regulations shall be issued as part of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations of the Department of Transportation. (b) Time for Issuing Regulations.SECTION 1.
