SECTION 1. 2. TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS IMPORT TERMINALS. No person shall export any natural gas from the United States to a foreign country or import any natural gas from a foreign country without first having secured an order of the Secretary of Energy authorizing such person to do so. The Secretary may by order grant such application, in whole or in part, with such modification and upon such terms and conditions as the Secretary may find necessary or appropriate, and may from time to time, after opportunity for hearing, and for good cause shown, make such supplemental order as the Secretary may find necessary or appropriate. With respect to natural gas which is imported into the United States from a nation with which there is in effect a free trade agreement requiring national treatment for trade in natural gas, and with respect to liquefied natural gas (1) the importation of such natural gas shall be treated as a `first sale' within the meaning of section 2(21) of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978; and (2) the Secretary of Energy shall not, on the basis of national origin, treat any such imported natural gas on an unjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory, or preferential basis. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission may by its order grant such application, in whole or in part, with such modification and upon such terms and conditions as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission may find necessary or appropriate. (3) Except as otherwise provided by Federal law, no State or local government may require a permit, license, concurrence, approval, certificate, or other form of authorization with respect to the siting, construction, expansion, or operation of a liquefied natural gas import terminal. (5) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to repeal or modify the authority under this section to authorize a person to import or export natural gas or to authorize facilities for the import or export of natural gas other than liquefied natural gas import terminals. If a Federal or State administrative agency or officer fails to complete a proceeding in accordance with the schedule established by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the action of the Federal or State administrative agency or officer that is required before a person may site, construct, expand, or operate the liquefied natural gas import terminal shall be conclusively presumed and the siting, construction, expansion, or operation shall proceed without condition. (4) Any Federal administrative proceeding that is an appeal or review of a decision made or action taken by a Federal administrative agency or officer (or State administrative agency or officer acting under delegated Federal authority) with respect to the siting, construction, expansion, or operation of a liquefied natural gas import terminal shall use as its exclusive record for all purposes the administrative record compiled by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission under paragraph (3). (2) If a civil action referred to in paragraph (1) is filed, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission shall file in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit the single administrative record compiled under subsection (e)(3) with respect to the liquefied natural gas import terminal named in the civil action. With respect to the siting, construction, expansion, or operation of a liquefied natural gas import terminal, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission shall be the lead Federal agency for purposes of complying with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U. 717a) is amended by adding at the end the following new paragraph: (11) `Liquefied natural gas import terminal' includes all facilities located onshore or in State waters that are used to receive, unload, store, transport, gasify, or process liquefied natural gas that is imported to the United States from a foreign country, but does not include the tankers used to deliver liquefied natural gas to such facilities.SECTION 1. 2.
