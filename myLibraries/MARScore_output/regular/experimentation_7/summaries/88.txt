SECTION 1. Congress finds the following: (1) The failure to reuse and recycle empty beverage containers represents a significant and unnecessary waste of important national energy and material resources. (2) The littering of empty beverage containers constitutes a public nuisance, safety hazard, and aesthetic blight and imposes on public agencies, private businesses, farmers, and landowners unnecessary costs for the collection and removal of the containers. (3) Solid waste resulting from the empty beverage containers constitutes a significant proportion of municipal solid waste and increases the cost and problems of effectively managing the disposal of the waste. (4) It is difficult for local communities to raise the necessary capital to initiate comprehensive recycling programs. (6) Several States have previously enacted and implemented State laws designed to protect the environment, conserve energy and material resources, and promote resource recovery of waste by requiring a refund value on the sale of all beverage containers. (7) The laws referred to in paragraph (6) have proven inexpensive for government to administer and effective at reducing financial burdens on communities by internalizing the cost of recycling and litter control to the producers and consumers of beverages. (8) A national system for requiring a refund value on the sale of all beverage containers would act as a positive incentive to individuals to clean up the environment and would (A) result in a high level of reuse and recycling of the containers; and (B) help reduce the costs associated with solid waste management. 3.
