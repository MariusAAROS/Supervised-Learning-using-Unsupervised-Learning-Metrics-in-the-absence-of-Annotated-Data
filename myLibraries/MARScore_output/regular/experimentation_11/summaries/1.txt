mirnas are a class of multifunctional singled stranded small rna which are ~20 nt in length and regulate the stability or translational efficiency of targeted messenger rna depending on the base pairing complementarity between the mirna and its target mrna [ 1 , 2 ]. mirna gene copy number gain / loss and mirna gene mutation have been observed in breast cancer resulting in the aberrant expression of mirna. mir21 , mir106a and mir155 were significantly over expressed in the tumor specimens compared with normal controls , whereas mir126 , mir199a and mir335 were significantly decreased in expression in the tumor samples. mir221/222 inhibited p27 and p57 abundance , facilitating g1s phase transition , thereby promoting cancer cell proliferation [ 36 , 37 ]. in colon cancer ,. enforced mir128 expression increased the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to doxorubicin induced apoptosis and dna damage. high throughput deep sequencing identified a group of small rnas matching pirna sequences in human breast cancer tissues and breast cancer cell lines.
