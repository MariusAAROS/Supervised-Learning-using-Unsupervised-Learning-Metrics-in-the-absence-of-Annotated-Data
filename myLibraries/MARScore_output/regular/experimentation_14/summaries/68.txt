the synthesis of these constructs requires a suite of chemoselective bioconjugation reactions that proceed under mild , aqueous conditions in the presence of the native functional groups that are present on protein surfaces. ms ( see supporting information figure s8 for representative ms data for the modified peptides ). the reactions were run under pseudo first order conditions with 0. the second order rate constant for the coupling was determined to be 44 4 m s. 0 ( figure 2b ). addition of the aniline containing protein to the native protein decreased the n terminal reactivity , indicating that the aniline residues react more rapidly than n terminal residues with the o aminophenols. the proline terminal variant showed much higher levels of modification than the wild type protein.
