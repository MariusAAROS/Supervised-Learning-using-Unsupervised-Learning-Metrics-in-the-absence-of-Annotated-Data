since last decade , fine needle aspiration cytology ( fnac ) has evolved as a simple , safe , and noninvasive preoperative tool in the diagnosis of bone tumors. ( h and e , 40 ) ( b ) cytology smears showing polygonal cells with vacuolization in clusters , with calcification seen in the letilower corner. fna aspirates of chondroblastoma show mononuclear cells arranged in a dispersed pattern like pebbles. these cells have well defined cell margins , glassy cytoplasm , and nucleus with indentation and grooving. the cause of misdiagnosis in one case was due to its association with abc , leading to nonrepresentative aspirate. in chondromyxoid fibroma , the smears are sparsely cellular and lack the mononuclear cell component. in addition to chondroblastoma , abc can occur secondarily in giant cell tumor and osteosarcoma.
