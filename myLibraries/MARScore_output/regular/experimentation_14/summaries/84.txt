then one of the tissues was placed in 10% formalin for histopathological studies and the others were used for the extraction of total rna. 0 , and rin >. the rna was converted to double stranded cdna and amplified using in vitro transcription with t7 polymerase ; the transcription reaction included aminoallyl utp ( aa dutp ) and the subsequent product was conjugated to cy5 nhs ester ( ge healthcare life sciences , pittsburg , pa ). the human whole genome onearray v4. this analysis not only helps finding hybridization with aberrant intensity distributions but also helps to confirm that the normalization of each replicate microarray has an appropriately centered distribution. up and down regulated genes were analyzed separately for each condition , so there are two separate worksheets listing enrichment analysis results. count = the number differentially expressed genes annotated with a given enriched term.
