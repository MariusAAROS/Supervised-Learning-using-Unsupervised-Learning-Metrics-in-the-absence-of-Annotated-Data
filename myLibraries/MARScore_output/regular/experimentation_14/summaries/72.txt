clearly , the resultant phase and amplitude errors can become very significant for multipath signals that are on the same order of magnitude as the desired signals. in this case. in these experiments. 2 , a + 5 dbm signal was transmitted at multiple frequencies over the 7002500 mhz range from a single antenna and received at the remaining 15 antennas. however , the amplitudes are considerably lower for the more distant receive antennas. , the attenuation follows a smooth curve hitting a maximum at antenna 8 ( which is furthest away from the transmitter being located on the opposite side of the array ). for the shorter propagation distances ( i.
