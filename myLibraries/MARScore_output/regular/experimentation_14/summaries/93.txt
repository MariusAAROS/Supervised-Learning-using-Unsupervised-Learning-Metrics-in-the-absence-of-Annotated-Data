1997. suppose the predominant strain of hiv is one that gives rise to a viremia too low for vector transmission ( i. , b1 0 ). , we can view any of these curves as general requirements for significant evolution of vector transmission to have occurred during the past 30 to 50 years. modeling the evolutionary consequences of this in hiv is difficult because each infected human will harbor a suite of genetic variants , some of which will be better at exploiting the human host. biological transmission : despite evidence that mechanical transmission of hiv by arthropods can occur , there is no evidence that biological transmission is possible. , the cost stems from an evolutionary trade off between these two transmission routes.
