we reviewed the charts of patients who visited the department of oral and maxillofacial surgery at chosun university dental hospital ( gwangju , korea ) and who had undergone enucleation after decompression. we measured the sizes of lesions in pre and post decompression panoramic photographs for each patient , measured width and length with a caliper , and multiplied them together to determine the lesion index ( li ) with the aim of simplifying measurement of irregularly sized lesions. patients were excluded from group review if they had no radiological data , if they had cured soft tissues due to the failure to maintain the window , or if they had been observed for less than six months after enucleation. in total , 17 patients ( 7 males and 10 females ) were reviewed , and their average age was 33. 2 ) radiographic results showed that all lesions were unilocular and were either pushing or intruding into the surrounding structures ( maxillary sinus or mandibular canal ) in 15 patients ( 88. 7 months for dc , suggesting that kcots require approximately three more months of treatment. also , when comparing size reduction based on patient age , the decrease was greater in patients in their teens or 20s compared to the other age groups , but the reduction rates were not significantly different.
