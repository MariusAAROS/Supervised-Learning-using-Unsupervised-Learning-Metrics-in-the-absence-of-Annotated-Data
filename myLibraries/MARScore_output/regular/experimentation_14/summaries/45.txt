ovotesticular dsd ( ot dsd ) is a rare condition marked by the presence of both ovarian and testicular tissue in an individual while congenital bilateral anorchia ( cba ) is characterized by the complete absence of testicular tissue in genotypic males. testosterone : androstenedione ( t : a ) and testosterone : 5 dht ( t:5dht ) ratios were calculated as and when required to rule out 17 beta hsd deficiency and 5 alpha reductase deficiency respectively. the presenting complaints , clinical , hormonal , and radiological findings are summarized in table 1. 4 had unilateral undescended testis with raised fsh and low testosterone levels , all three were suspected to be cases of pgd. 14 , s. in our study , four patients were diagnosed with pgd , one with cgd , one with ot dsd , and two with testicular agenesis or cba. with parents consent clitorovaginoplasty and bilateral orchidectomy.ovotesticular dsd ( ot dsd ) is a rare condition marked by the presence of both ovarian and testicular tissue in an individual while congenital bilateral anorchia ( cba ) is characterized by the complete absence of testicular tissue in genotypic males. testosterone : androstenedione ( t : a ) and testosterone : 5 dht ( t:5dht ) ratios were calculated as and when required to rule out 17 beta hsd deficiency and 5 alpha reductase deficiency respectively. the presenting complaints , clinical , hormonal , and radiological findings are summarized in table 1. 4 had unilateral undescended testis with raised fsh and low testosterone levels , all three were suspected to be cases of pgd. 14 , s. in our study , four patients were diagnosed with pgd , one with cgd , one with ot dsd , and two with testicular agenesis or cba. with parents consent clitorovaginoplasty and bilateral orchidectomy.
