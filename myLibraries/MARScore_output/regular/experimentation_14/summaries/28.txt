ureterocele is a congenital urinary abnormality characterized by the presence of an intrabladder hernia or cystic ballooning of the lower end of a ureter lying between the mucosa and muscle of the bladder. usg and voiding cystourethrography ( vcug ) are essential initial procedures for a child suspected of having a ureteral anomaly. faint visualization of radiotracer was noted through the pcn tube after removal of clamp [ figure 2b , bold arrow ]. right ureter and right pelvicalyceal system visualization is noted suggesting indirect evidence of vesico ureteric reflux ( thin arrow ). hence , an intravenous pyelogram , radioisotope renogram , and micturating cystourethrogram are invaluable in the complete understanding of ureterocele. photopenia was noted in the ub on our scan , and this prompted us to investigate the patient further. repeat usg revealed the cause of photopenia in ub in our case to be an intravesical ureterocele.ureterocele is a congenital urinary abnormality characterized by the presence of an intrabladder hernia or cystic ballooning of the lower end of a ureter lying between the mucosa and muscle of the bladder. usg and voiding cystourethrography ( vcug ) are essential initial procedures for a child suspected of having a ureteral anomaly. faint visualization of radiotracer was noted through the pcn tube after removal of clamp [ figure 2b , bold arrow ]. right ureter and right pelvicalyceal system visualization is noted suggesting indirect evidence of vesico ureteric reflux ( thin arrow ). hence , an intravenous pyelogram , radioisotope renogram , and micturating cystourethrogram are invaluable in the complete understanding of ureterocele. photopenia was noted in the ub on our scan , and this prompted us to investigate the patient further. repeat usg revealed the cause of photopenia in ub in our case to be an intravesical ureterocele.
