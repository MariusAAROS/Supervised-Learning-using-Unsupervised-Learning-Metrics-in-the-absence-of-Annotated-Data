513% due to poor reliability of traditional protocols , algorithms , and combinations of screening tools in identifying a potentially difficult airway. further demonstrated that the anterior neck soft tissue thickness measured by ultrasound at hyoid bone and thyrohyoid membrane levels can be used as an index to predict difficult laryngoscopy , but only the anterior neck soft tissue thickness at thyrohyoid membrane levels can be used as an independent predictor of difficult laryngoscopy. statistical analyses were performed using medcalc for windows , version 12. 43 kg / m for the easy laryngoscopy group ( p<0. 68 , p<0. 0001 ) , 0. 32 ( 0.
