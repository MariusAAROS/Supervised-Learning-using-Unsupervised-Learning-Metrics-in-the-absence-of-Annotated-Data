hvc ( used as the proper name ) is the beginning nucleus of both pathways and projects to the robust nucleus of the arcopallium ( ra ) and afp. the former is mediated by a mixture of n methyl d aspartate ( nmda ) and amino3hydroxy5methyl4isoxazolepropionic acid ( ampa ) type receptors [ 4 , 10 , 11 ] , and the latter is mediated almost exclusively by nmda type receptors. standard acsf consists of ( in mm ) nacl 125 , nahco3 25 , nah2po4h2o 1. 00 hz / na before nmda application and increased to 325. 05 ) ; however , the gain modulation induced by nmda was completely abolished by dl apv ( figure 4 ). 46 59. in songbirds , we found that nmda increased the slope of f i relationship in ra projection neurons , which was completely blocked by dl apv , a nmda receptor selective antagonist , suggesting that nmda increased the sensitivity of ra projection neurons.
