representative chemopreventive agents that induce nrf2 include carotenoids , curcumins , cyclic lactones , diterpenes , dithiolethiones , epithionitriles , flavonoids , indoles , isothiocyanates , organosulfides , and phenols. 1a ). 2a). another model is the keap cul3 dissociation model in which oxidative stress disrupts the keap1cul3 e3 ligase interaction without changing the conformation of keap1. 16 the cross talk between nfb and nrf2 is more complex. 18 in contrast , nrf2 inhibits the activity of nfb by attenuating phosphorylated ib. 21 in contrast , direct targets of p53 could upregulate nrf2 activity.
