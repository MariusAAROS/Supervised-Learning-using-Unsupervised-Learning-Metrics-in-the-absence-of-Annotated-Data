serum was collected at these same time points and pct , strem1 , nt pro bnp , crp , il6 , and il10 levels were determined in the end. quantitative data that were not normally distributed were summarized as medians ( interquartile ranges ) and compared by nonparametric tests ( mann whitney u test ). 05 ) ( table 2 ). , we found that there was no significant difference of auc between strem1 and pct ( p = 0. median serum biomarkers and cytokines levels were determined on days 1 , 3 , and 5 and were compared between the survival and nonsurvival groups. serum crp levels in both surviving and nonsurviving groups had decrease tendency ( p < 0. some studies failed to find the association between strem1 and poor outcome [ 8 , 13 ].
