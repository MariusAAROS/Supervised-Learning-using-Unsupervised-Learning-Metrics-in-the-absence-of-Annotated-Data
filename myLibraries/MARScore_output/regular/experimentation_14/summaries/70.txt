in total , they were each asked to drink 10 l of liquid ( tap water and rehydration solutions ) per day. humidity and dew point were measured by using a portable temperature monitoring device ( easylog , model el usb2 ). wet bulb globe temperature ( wbgt ) values during the 2007 harvest season at montelimar farm descriptive statistics were used to analyse climate data ( temperature ( c ) ; relative humidity ( % ) ; dew point ( c ) ) ; liquid intake and output production. descriptive statistics were used to analyse climate data ( temperature ( c ) ; relative humidity ( % ) ; dew point ( c ) ) ; liquid intake and output production. measurements of heart rate and body weight at the start and end of the working day showed that workers experienced increases in heart rate and loss of body weight as they worked in these hot conditions. although only 22 subjects were followed up for a short period of time in this study , important results were obtained. since dehydration reduces the capacity for absorption from the gut , workers must be educated regarding the importance of drinking enough water during work and continuing generous rehydration during off duty hours ( 14 ).
