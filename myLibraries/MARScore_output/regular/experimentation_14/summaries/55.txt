remarkably , nail matrix keratinocytes that differentiate into specialized nail corneocytes , the building blocks of the nail plate , do not express caspase14 ( jager et al. the expression of caspase14 in the hassall 's bodies of the thymus and in the forestomach of rodents is somewhat expected , as they are cornifying structures and express the typical late differentiation markers , such as profilaggrin and loricrin , which are also found in the epidermis ( laster and haynes , 1986 ; favre , 1989 ; jarnik et al. down regulation of several differentiation associated genes by retinoids has been shown to be mediated by the transrepression of activator protein 1 ( ap1)mediated gene activation ( fisher and voorhees , 1996 ). 2 ) reveals a conserved hydrophobic patch that is n terminal of the caspase14 cleavage site. however , the following findings indicate that activation of caspase14 occurs at the interface between the granular and cornified layers of the epidermis or early during cornification. , 2004 ). these processes are clearly distinct pathways executed by different players ( for review see lippens et al.
