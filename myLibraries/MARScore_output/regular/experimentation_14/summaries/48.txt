the purpose of this study was ( 1 ) to analyze the overall and comparative clinico radiological outcomes ( radiographic and ultrasonographic ) of surgical treatment of distal clavicle fractures associated with complete coracoclavicular ligament disruption , and ( 2 ) to identify and analyze radiographic patterns of fracture and comminution that are associated with this injury. inclusion criteria for this study was defined as : ( i ) acute , isolated , non comminuted and comminuted fractures of the lateral clavicle , ( ii ) complete disruption of both coracoclavicular ligaments , confirmed on radiographs and at surgery , ( iii ) absence of concomitant or pre existing subacromial pathology ( rotator cuff tears , acromial undersurface degeneration ) , ( iv ) surgical treatment with either a joint spanning implant alone ( group 1 ) , or combination of a joint sparing implant and coracoclavicular fixation with either endobutton device , suture anchor , or coracoid cerclage ( group 2 ) [ figures 1a and b ] , and ( v ) follow up period of at least 6 months for radiographic evidence of union.
