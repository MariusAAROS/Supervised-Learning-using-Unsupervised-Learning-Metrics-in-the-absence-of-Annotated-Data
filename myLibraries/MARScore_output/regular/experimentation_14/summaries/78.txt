a stent is an appliance used for radiographic evaluation of height and width of the available bone during treatment planning for implant placement or during surgical procedures to provide site for optimum implant placement. , it is now possible to construct a surgical implant stent that would allow the clinician to predetermine implant locations virtually and surgically place them without reflecting a tissue flap. the aim of the study was to demonstrate the accuracy and clinical precision of conventional surgical stent protocol for optimum installation of dental implants in terms of position and diameter. then , the impression of that waxed up cast was taken and poured to reproduce another cast with the missing teeth / tooth replaced by dental stone. then , mesiodistal and buccolingual markings were drawn over these teeth / tooth to find a center point on the occlusal surface [ figure 4 ]. a template that provides radiographic evaluation of the implant site and precise or modified surgical placement. it can be fabricated with minimum laboratory procedures which are used in routine dental practice.
