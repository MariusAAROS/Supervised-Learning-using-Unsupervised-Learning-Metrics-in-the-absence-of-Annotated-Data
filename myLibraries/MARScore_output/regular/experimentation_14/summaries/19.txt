all patients were scanned on 64 slice ge helical ct ( ge high speed advantage ) scanner and had an echo done within 1 week of the ct scan. the reconstruction was performed with the reconstruction window starting at 10% of r r interval and up to 90% r r interval with increment of 10%. ( c ) patient 3 : left ventricular ejection fraction by ct 60. bland altman analysis [ figure 5 ] was used to compare the lvef measured with mdct and that with 2d tte. r = pearson correlation coefficient , p = p value , ef = ejection fraction bland and altman showing the correlation of echo ef and ct ef. the mean lvef calculated by clinical echo was 58. the mountain plot analysis reinforced that ef measured by ct correlated well with that measured by echo.all patients were scanned on 64 slice ge helical ct ( ge high speed advantage ) scanner and had an echo done within 1 week of the ct scan. the reconstruction was performed with the reconstruction window starting at 10% of r r interval and up to 90% r r interval with increment of 10%.
