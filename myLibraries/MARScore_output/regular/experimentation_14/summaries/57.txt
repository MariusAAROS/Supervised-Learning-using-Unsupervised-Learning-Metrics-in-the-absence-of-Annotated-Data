in a 60year old woman with an asymptomatic choroidal nevus , normal oct was used to observe the macula and edi oct to image the choroidal nevus that was inaccessible to ultrasound. we observed a thickened choroid delineated by the shadow cone behind it , measuring 1,376 325 m in the larger vertical cut and 1,220 325 m in the larger horizontal cut in an image with a 1:1 pixel mapping and automatic zoom. , enhanced depth imaging oct ( edi oct ) has been used in order to measure choroidal thickness in normal and pathologic eyes [ 3 , 4 ]. 2 ). the diameter of the nevus was calculated based on the presence of a shadow cone created by the lesion 's lateral borders. the choroidal thickness was measured based on the hyperreflectivity between the bruch 's membrane and the beginning of the shadow cone ( fig. , these follow up images must be obtained and compared with the same sd oct machine.
