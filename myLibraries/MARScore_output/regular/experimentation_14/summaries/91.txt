the success of valproic acid ( vpa , 2propylpentanoic acid ) , a short branched chain fatty acid , for the therapy of absence seizures , partial seizures , tonic clonic seizures , bipolar disorder , schizoaffective disorder , social phobias , neuropathic pain and for the prophylaxis and treatment of migraine headaches has spurred investigation for its use in the treatment of other conditions. in contrast , later on in the patient 's clinical course her raised venous ammonia levels were found to be slowly down trending in the presence of sub therapeutic serum vpa. this patient had recently started taking vpa ( depakote ) as a mood stabilizer at a dose of 250 mg at bed time about 3 days earlier , after a failed therapy. the normalized log linear plot of vpa serum concentration over time showed a down trending linear first order kinetics with a calculated t = 15. in a review of 11 case reports of symptomatic hyperammonemia in a psychiatric setting it was noted that acute hyperammonemic encephalopathy in psychiatric patients may present in various ways , sometimes with subtle clinical features. we observed presence of vpa in serum caused increased venous ammonia levels , which eventually trended down to normal after its cessation. we also made the following observations : ( 1 ) raised venous ammonia levels may remain symptomatic for a significant period of time beyond discontinuation of vpa.
