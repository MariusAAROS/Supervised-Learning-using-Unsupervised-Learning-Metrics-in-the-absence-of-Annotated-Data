although the cytocompatibility of a biomaterial is strongly influenced by its chemical composition , surface topography plays a crucial role for cell surface interactions. . these results were confirmed by the group of webster and other investigators [ 6871 ] who demonstrated that the initial attachment of osteoblasts onto the surface of biometals such as cpti , ti6al4v , and cocrmo is enhanced by submicron to nanometer consistent particles compared to metals composed of respective micron particles. ( 2 ) close contacts : corresponding to approximately 30 nm separation ( broader grey areas in tem ). for the first time , in 1964 it was shown that convex surfaces enhance cellular overlap , while grooves minimize cellular overlap. most authors report a parallel orientation of cells cultured on polished ( smooth ) surfaces [ 57 , 114 , 126 ] ( figure 4 ). another study on nb2o5coated polished cpti samples showed that mc3t3e1osteoblast migration was fastest on smooth surfaces ( ra = 7 nm ) , whereas adhesion strength , spreading area , and collagen i synthesis were promoted by intermediate roughness ( ra = 15 nm ).
