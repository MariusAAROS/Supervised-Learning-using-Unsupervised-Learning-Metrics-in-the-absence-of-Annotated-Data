SECTION 1. 2. Congress finds that (1) wetland and tidal marshes in the Chesapeake Bay, the State of Louisiana, and other coastal States provide significant cultural, economic, and ecological benefits to the United States; (2) the South American nutria (Myocastor coypus) is directly contributing to substantial marsh loss on Federal, State, and private land in the States of Maryland and Louisiana and other coastal States; (3) the Nutria Eradication and Control Act of 2003 (Public Law 10816; 117 Stat. 621) and the Coastal Wetlands Planning, Protection, and Restoration Act (16 U. S. 621) that are eradicating nutria from the State of Maryland and are reducing the acres of nutriaimpacted wetland in Louisiana, should be applied to nutria eradication or control programs in other nutriainfested coastal States. There is established a nutria eradication program under which the Secretary may, subject to the availability of appropriations, provide financial assistance to the States of Maryland and Louisiana and the coastal States to implement measures (1) to eradicate or control nutria; and (2) to restore wetland damaged by nutria. Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary and the National Invasive Species Council shall (1) for purposes of the program, give consideration to (A) the 2002 report for the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries entitled Nutria in Louisiana; and (B) the March 2009 update of the document entitled Eradication Strategies for the Nutria in the Chesapeake and Delaware Bay Watersheds and dated March 2002; (2) continue, in cooperation with the State of Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries and the State of Maryland Department of Natural Resources, a longterm nutria control or eradication program, as appropriate, with the objective to significantly reduce and restore the damage nutria cause to coastal wetland in the States of Louisiana and Maryland; and (3) develop, in cooperation with the State of Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control, the State of Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries, the State of Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, and the State of Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, longterm nutria control or eradication programs, as appropriate, with the objective to significantly reduce and restore the damage nutria cause to coastal wetland in the coastal States.
