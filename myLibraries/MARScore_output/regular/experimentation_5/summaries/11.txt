SHORT TITLE. In the case of an employer which is a systemically significant financial institution, this subsection shall apply with the following modifications: (i) Nonpublic entities. Any employee whose applicable employee remuneration for the taxable year exceeds $1,000,000 is presumed to engage in actions which have a material impact on the risk exposure of the taxpayer unless the taxpayer submits an information return to the Secretary which describes the role and responsibilities of such employee and the reason such employee should not be considered to have a material impact on the risk exposure of the taxpayer. In the case of any deferred deduction executive remuneration (as determined under rules similar to the rules of paragraph (5)(F), if executive remuneration for purposes of such paragraph included remuneration of covered employees as defined in clause (ii) of this paragraph, and if the year in which the applicable services were performed were treated as an applicable taxable year), rules similar to the rules of paragraph (5)(A)(ii) shall apply by substituting `$1,000,000' for `$500,000'. (i) In general. For purposes of this paragraph, the term `systemically significant financial institution' means an entity which engages primarily in activities which are financial in nature (as determined under section 4(k) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956), and which (I) owns or controls assets greater than $25,000,000,000, or (II) owns or controls assets greater than $10,000,000,000 and maintains a ratio of debt to equity which is greater than 20 to 1. A taxpayer which is a systemically significant financial institution for any taxable year shall be a systemically significant financial institution for purposes of all subsequent taxable years. Remuneration payable solely on account of the attainment of one or more performance goals (hereinafter `performancebased remuneration') which is paid by any systemically significant financial institution to any covered employee (as determined under subparagraph (A)(ii)) shall not be excluded under subparagraph (C) of paragraph (4) from treatment as applicable employee remuneration unless the following requirements are met: (i) Performancebased compensation pool. The amount and allocation of the taxpayer's performancebased remuneration for covered employees are determined by the compensation committee required under paragraph (4)(C)(i) by taking into account (I) the cost and quantity of capital required to support the risks taken by the taxpayer in the conduct of the financial activities of the taxpayer, (II) the cost and quantity of the liquidity risk assumed by the taxpayer in the conduct of such activities, and (III) the timing and likelihood of potential future revenues from such activities. In the case of a systemically significant financial institution which is not a publicly held corporation, in addition to the requirements of subparagraph (C), paragraph (4)(C) shall be applied by substituting the following for clauses (i) through (iii) thereof: (i) the taxpayer commissions an annual, external review of its compensation policies and practices, including an examination and analysis of the taxpayer's compliance with the requirements of this subsection, and (ii) the taxpayer obtains certification from an unrelated third party commissioned to evaluated compensation practices that performance goals and other material terms under which the remuneration is to be paid are satisfied before any payment of such remuneration is made. In the case of any systemically significant financial institution to which paragraph (5) applies for any taxable year, this paragraph shall not apply to any payment of remuneration to which such paragraph applies. Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this paragraph, the Secretary shall prescribe such guidance, rules, or regulations of general applicability as are necessary to carry out the purposes of this paragraph, including (i) the method for valuing assets for purposes of subparagraph (B)(i), (ii) the method for calculating the ratio described in subparagraph (B)(i)(II), (iii) criteria for use in determining whether the actions of an employee have a material impact on the risk exposure of the taxpayer, and for determining what constitutes a substantial forfeiture requirement with respect to executive remuneration, (iv) criteria for determining whether a remuneration agreement constitutes a hedging strategy, and (v) antiabuse rules to prevent the avoidance of the purposes of this paragraph, including by use of independent contractors.SHORT TITLE.
