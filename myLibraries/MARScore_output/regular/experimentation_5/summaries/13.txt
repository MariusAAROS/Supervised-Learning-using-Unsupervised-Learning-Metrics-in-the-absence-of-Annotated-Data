or (ii) pursuant to any other exception that the Bureau determines is appropriate; (B) prescribe the methods by which a consumer may make a request to a depository institution to close a covered account, which, except as provided in subparagraph (C), shall include requests made in person, over the phone, or by other electronic or remote means; (C) allow a depository institution to require that a request by a consumer to close a covered account shall be made in person if the covered account contains an amount on deposit exceeding a certain monetary threshold, as determined and established by the Bureau; (D) establish procedures that require a depository institution to positively verify the identity of a consumer requesting to close a covered account before the depository institution closes the covered account, including procedures for a depository institution to follow if the depository institution is unable to verify the identity of the consumer; (E) establish procedures for a depository institution to provide a consumer with the funds contained in a covered account that the consumer has requested to close, which shall include procedures (i) that ensure that the consumer whose identity has been positively verified by the depository institution has access to any funds available for withdrawal at the time the consumer makes a request to the depository institution to close the covered account; (ii) that establish a reasonable amount of time for the depository institution to remit to the consumer the remainder of any funds in the closed covered account, including funds that are subject to a dispute between the depository institution and the consumer; and (iii) that allow a consumer whose identity has been positively verified by the depository institution to receive available funds from a covered account that the consumer has requested to close in the form of (I) a cashier's check provided to the consumer; (II) an electronic funds transfer to an account designated by the consumer; (III) any means offered by the depository institution that the consumer has requested; or (IV) any means that the Bureau determines appropriate; (F) except as provided under subparagraph (G), prohibit a depository institution from imposing any fee or charge on a covered account at the depository institution after the consumer has requested to close the covered account; (G) allow a depository institution to assess an overdraft fee after a consumer has requested to close a covered account, if such overdraft fee is associated with a transaction that was initiated by the consumer before the date on which the consumer made a request to the depository institution to close the covered account; (H) not limit the ability of a consumer to earn interest that a covered account had accrued before the date on which the consumer made a request to the depository institution to close the covered account; (I) establish procedures for a depository institution and a consumer to follow if a personal check written by the consumer is deposited by a person other than the consumer after the date on which the consumer has closed a covered account; (J) require the depository institution to provide the consumer with certain information before the depository institution closes a covered account of the consumer, including (i) a list of any preauthorized transactions relating to the covered account that occurred within the 60 days preceding the date on which the consumer made a request to the depository institution to close the covered account; (ii) a list of any preauthorized transactions scheduled to occur in the 60 days after the date on which the consumer made a request to the depository institution to close the covered account; (iii) a list of any direct deposits into the covered account in the 60 days preceding the date on which the consumer made a request to the depository institution to close the covered account; and (iv) any other information that the Bureau determines is necessary to provide consumers with adequate information about potential preauthorized activity relating to the covered account; (K) prohibit a depository institution from reporting an outstanding balance or any other adverse information with respect to a covered account at the depository institution to any consumer reporting agency, as defined in section 603(f) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U. 1681a), if the depository institution (i) notifies the consumer of the negative balance; and (ii) provides the consumer with a reasonable period of time, as determined and established by the Bureau, to repay the negative balance; and (M) include any other provisions, guidance, or exceptions that the Bureau determines are appropriate in order to facilitate the purposes of this section.
