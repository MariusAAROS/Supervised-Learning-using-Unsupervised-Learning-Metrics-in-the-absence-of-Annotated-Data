Congress finds as follows: (1) There is a lack of transparency and consistency concerning inspections by the Food and Drug Administration of medical device establishments around the world, which leads to inefficiencies and inconsistencies and undermines confidence in United States standards. (3) The frequency and nature of inspections of device establishments are not consistently riskbased, and a comprehensive, transparent, riskbased approach to inspections would result in greater focus on the more significant risks to public health while reducing the burdens on establishments with a strong track record of compliance. (9) There is a lack of transparency in the export certification process with respect to device establishments for which FDA Form 483 has been used to document issues noticed during an inspection conducted pursuant to section 704 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U. S. 374) or establishments that have received Warning Letters in connection with such an inspection, and between domestic and foreign establishments, resulting in devices that are lawfully marketed for United States patients being denied certification for marketing in other countries. The Secretary, acting through one or more officers or employees duly designated by the Secretary, shall inspect establishments described in paragraph (1) that are engaged in the manufacture, propagation, compounding, or processing of a device or devices (referred to in this subsection as `device establishments') in accordance with one riskbased inspection schedule established by the Secretary, applied consistently across regional offices. In establishing the riskbased schedule under subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall (i) apply, to the extent applicable for device establishments, the factors identified in paragraph (4); and (ii) consider the participation of the device establishment, as applicable, in international device audit programs in which the United States participates or the United States recognizes for purposes of inspecting. Such process shall include (A) notifying the owner, operator, or agent in charge of the establishment of the type and nature of the inspection; (B) announcing the inspection the establishment within a reasonable time before such inspection; (C) in the case of inspections other than forcause inspections, providing a reasonable estimate of the timeframe for the inspection, an opportunity for advance communications between the officers or employees carrying out the inspection under subsection (a)(1) and the owner, operator, or agent in charge of the establishment concerning appropriate working hours during the inspection, and, to the extent feasible, advance notice of records that will be requested in order to expedite the inspection; and (D) daily communications with the owner, operator, or agent in charge of the establishment regarding inspection status, which may be recorded by either party with advance notice. (ii) If the denial of a request as described in clause (i) is based on grounds other than an injunction proceeding pursuant to section 302, seizure action pursuant to section 304, or a recall designated Class I or Class II pursuant to part 7, title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, the Secretary shall provide a substantive summary of the specific deficiencies identified. (ii) Notwithstanding any previous review conducted pursuant to clause (i), a person who has been denied a certification as described in subparagraph (E)(i) may at any time request a review in order to present new information relating to actions taken by such person to address the reasons identified by the Secretary for the denial of certification, including corrective actions to address deficiencies identified by the Secretary.
