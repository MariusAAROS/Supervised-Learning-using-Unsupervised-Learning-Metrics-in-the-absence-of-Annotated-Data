SECTION 1. Congress finds the following: (1) Low income people are subject to many taxes, including the Federal income tax, payroll taxes, and State income taxes. The rates at which the benefits from such programs are phased out have the same effect as additional taxes imposed on the beneficiaries. (2) The total effective marginal rate of tax for additional income earned by low income people can exceed 100 percent and can be a disincentive to working more hours, getting a raise, learning a more lucrative trade, getting married, or engaging in other economic or social activities. SEC. NATIONAL COMMISSION ON MARGINAL TAX RATES FOR THE WORKING POOR. The Commission shall (1) determine the total effective marginal rate of tax from all taxes and benefit program phaseouts that persons are subject to (both as individuals and as married couples) at all earnings levels between $7,000 and $30,000 per year for at least 5 States, including Wisconsin and California; and (2) submit the report required under subsection (f) to Congress. The Commission shall be composed of 12 members, of whom (A) 3 shall be appointed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives; (B) 2 shall be appointed by the Minority Leader of the House of Representatives; (C) 3 shall be appointed by the Majority Leader of the Senate; (D) 2 shall be appointed by the Minority Leader of the Senate; and (E) 2 shall be appointed by the President. (3) Background. (d) Staff and Support Services.
