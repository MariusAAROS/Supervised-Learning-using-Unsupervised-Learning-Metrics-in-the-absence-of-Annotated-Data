The State shall require that a qualified community health system submit an action plan for an initiative to the State agency with responsibility for administering the State plan under this title for approval that identifies (A) the target population or populations to be served by the initiative; (B) specific, evidencebased projects that the system will undertake through the initiative to reduce health disparities for such population or populations; (C) targets and benchmarks associated with such projects that must be met in order to receive incentive payments pursuant to this section; (D) measures for evaluating the effectiveness of the initiative in reducing health disparities with respect to the goals established by the State pursuant to subsection (b)(1); and (E) the amount of any proposed initial incentive payments to be made pursuant to this section to support startup costs of the initiative.

Of the total amount appropriated for this section for a fiscal year, the Secretary shall, except as provided in subparagraph (D), allocate for such fiscal year to each State an amount in proportion to the ratio of (i) the State's total expenditures under the State plan under this title in the most recent fiscal year for which complete expenditure data is available; to (ii) the sum of all States' total expenditures under all State plans under this title in the fiscal year described in clause (i). Allocations made to a qualifying State under clause (i) and subparagraph (C) shall remain available until expended. Incentive payments made under a State plan amendment approved under this section shall not be considered payment for health care items or services and shall not count towards any limit with respect to the maximum amount of payments that may be made to a provider under the State plan under this title (or under a waiver of such plan).
