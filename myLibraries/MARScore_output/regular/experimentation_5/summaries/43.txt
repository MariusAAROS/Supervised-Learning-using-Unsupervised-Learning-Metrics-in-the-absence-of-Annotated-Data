SECTION 1. (3) Although motor carriers and their drivers often receive trailers, chassis, containers, and other items of intermodal equipment to be transported in interstate commerce, they do not possess the requisite level of control or authority over this intermodal equipment to perform the systematic maintenance, repair, and inspection necessary to ensure compliance with the applicable Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations and to ensure the safety of United States highways. The purpose of this Act is to ensure that only those parties that control intermodal equipment transported on public highways in the United States (and thus have the opportunity and authority to systematically maintain, repair, and inspect the intermodal equipment) have legal responsibility for the safety of that equipment as it travels in interstate commerce. Section 5901 of title 49, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new paragraphs: (9) `motor carrier' includes (A) a motor private carrier, as defined in section 13102 of this title; and (B) an agent of a motor carrier. (11) `equipment interchange agreement', with respect to intermodal equipment, means a written document that (A) is executed by a controller of the equipment, or its agent, and a motor carrier; and (B) establishes the responsibilities and liabilities of both parties as they relate to the interchange of the equipment. (13) `interchange', with respect to intermodal equipment, means the act of providing the equipment to a motor carrier for the purpose of transporting the equipment for loading or unloading by any party or repositioning the equipment for the benefit of the equipment controller, except that such term does not mean the leasing of the equipment to a motor carrier for use in the motor carrier's overtheroad freight hauling operations. SEC. Jurisdiction over equipment controller The authority of the Secretary of Transportation to prescribe regulations on commercial motor vehicle safety under section 31136 of this title shall apply to controllers of intermodal equipment that is interchanged or to be interchanged. (b) Reimbursement. Notwithstanding any provision of an equipment interchange agreement, the controller of intermodal equipment covered by such agreement shall be liable for each violation of applicable safety regulations that is attributable to such equipment and shall pay any fine, penalty, and damages resulting from such violation, except that the controller of such equipment shall not be liable for any such violations that is proximately caused by the negligence or willful misconduct of a motor carrier that is not the controller of such equipment. No record or report of a violation of applicable safety regulations attributable to interchanged intermodal equipment, whether issued by a Federal, State, or local law enforcement authority, shall have any effect on a motor carrier's overall safety rating or safety status measurement system score, as determined by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, or on a driving record of a driver for the motor carrier unless such violation was proximately caused by the negligence or willful misconduct of the motor carrier or driver, respectively. AUTHORITY TO INSPECT. A controller of intermodal equipment may not take any action to threaten, coerce, discipline, discriminate, or otherwise retaliate against a motor carrier in response to a request made by the motor carrier for maintenance or repair of equipment intended for interchange in order to comply with the applicable safety regulations. Upon receiving a motor carrier's request for maintenance or repair of intermodal equipment to be picked up by the motor carrier in an interchange of equipment, the controller of intermodal equipment shall be considered to have retaliated against the motor carrier for the purposes of this section if the controller of intermodal equipment fails to provide the motor carrier with the equipment in a condition compliant with the applicable safety regulations within 60 minutes after the motor carrier arrives to pick up the equipment at the place where the equipment is to be picked up. A controller of intermodal equipment that violates subsection (a) shall be liable to the United States Government for a civil penalty of up to $10,000 for each violation. Chapter 59 of title 49, United States Code, as amended by section 9, is further amended by adding at the end the following new section: Sec. Except as provided in subsection (b) or as otherwise authorized by Federal law, a law, regulation, order, or other requirement of a State or political subdivision of a State, or of a tribal organization, is preempted if compliance with such law, regulation, order, or other requirement would preclude compliance with a requirement imposed under this chapter. In this section, the term `tribal organization' has the meaning given such term in section (4)(l) of the Indian SelfDetermination and Education Assistance Act (25 U. SEC. The implementing regulations shall include (1) a requirement to identify controllers of intermodal equipment that is interchanged or intended for interchange in intermodal transportation; (2) a requirement to match such equipment readily to its controller through a unique identifying number; (3) a requirement to ensure that each controller of intermodal equipment maintains a system of maintenance and repair records for such equipment; (4) a requirement to evaluate the compliance of controllers of intermodal equipment with the applicable Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations; (5) a provision that prohibits controllers of intermodal equipment that fail to attain satisfactory compliance with such regulations from authorizing the placement of equipment on public highways; (6) a requirement for the Secretary to consider the effect that adequate maintenance facilities may have on safety condition of equipment; (7) a process by which motor carriers and agents of motor carriers may anonymously petition the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration to undertake an investigation of a noncompliant controller of intermodal equipment; (8) administrative procedures to resolve disputes arising under the regulations; and (9) the inspection and audit program required under section 5912(b) of title 49, United States Code, as added by section 8. The regulations required under subsection (a) shall be developed pursuant to a rulemaking proceeding initiated not later than 120 days after the date of the enactment of this Act and shall be issued not later than one year after such date of enactment. For the purposes of this section, the definitions set forth in section 5901 of title 49, United States Code, as amended by section 4, shall apply.SECTION 1.
