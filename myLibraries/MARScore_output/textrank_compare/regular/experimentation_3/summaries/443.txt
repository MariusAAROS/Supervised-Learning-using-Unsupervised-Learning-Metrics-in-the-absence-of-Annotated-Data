For purposes of section 116, in the case of any dividend (other than a dividend described in subsection (a)) received from a regulated investment company which meets the requirements of section 852 for the taxable year in which it paid the dividend (A) the entire amount of such dividend shall be treated as a dividend if the aggregate dividends and interest received by such company during the taxable year equal or exceed 75 percent of its gross income, or (B) if subparagraph (A) does not apply, a portion of such dividend shall be treated as a dividend (and a portion of such dividend shall be treated as interest) based on the portion of the company's gross income which consists of aggregate dividends or aggregate interest, as the case may be. (6) Subsection (c) of section 857 of such Code is amended to read as follows: (c) Limitations Applicable to Dividends Received From Real Estate Investment Trusts. In the case of a dividend (other than a capital gain dividend, as defined in subsection (b)(3)(C)) received from a real estate investment trust which meets the requirements of this part for the taxable year in which it paid the dividend (A) such dividend shall be treated as interest if the aggregate interest received by the real estate investment trust for the taxable year equals or exceeds 75 percent of its gross income, or (B) if subparagraph (A) does not apply, the portion of such dividend which bears the same ratio to the amount of such dividend as the aggregate interest received bears to gross income shall be treated as interest. (3) Subsection (c) of section 584 of such Code is amended by adding at the end thereof the following new sentence: The proportionate share of each participant in the amount of dividends or interest received by the common trust fund and to which section 116 applies shall be considered for purposes of such section as having been received by such participant. The term `aggregate dividends received' includes only dividends received from domestic corporations other than dividends described in section 116(b)(2). SECTION 1.
