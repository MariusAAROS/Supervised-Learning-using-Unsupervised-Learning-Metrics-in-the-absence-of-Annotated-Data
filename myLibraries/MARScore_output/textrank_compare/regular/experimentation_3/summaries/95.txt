The United States national should not discriminate in terms or conditions of employment in the commercial cooperation project against former members of the armed forces of the Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam), former government officials of the Republic of Vietnam, former employees of the United States Government in the Republic of Vietnam, former employees of United States Government officials in the Republic of Vietnam, former employees of United States enterprises in the Republic of Vietnam, and repatriated asylumseekers (so called boat people). It is the purpose of this Act to create principles governing the conduct of commercial cooperation projects of United States nationals in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. The Secretary of State shall submit a report to the Congress and to the Secretariat of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, describing the level of adherence to the principles described in section 1(b) by United States nationals subject to the reporting requirement of subsection (a). Such term does not include multilateral or bilateral governmenttogovernment trade negotiations intended to resolve trade issues which may affect United States nationals who do not adhere to the principles. It is the sense of the Congress that any United States national conducting a commercial cooperation project in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam should adhere to the following principles: (1) Seek to ensure that political or religious views, sex, ethnic or national background, involvement in political activities or nonviolent demonstrations, or association with suspected or known dissidents will not prohibit hiring, lead to harassment, demotion, or dismissal, or in any way affect the status or terms of employment in the commercial cooperation project. (5) Undertake to promote freedom of association and assembly among the employees of the United States national, including the right of employees to form collective bargaining units. The United States national should protest any infringement by the Government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam of these freedoms to the appropriate authorities of that government and to the International Labor Organization.
