Not later than 60 days after an employer places an individual in a supervisory employment position or 1 year after the date of the enactment of this Act, whichever occurs later, such employer shall provide to the supervisory employee information specifying the responsibilities of, and the methods to be used by, such employee to ensure that immediate and corrective action is taken to address allegations of sexual harassment in employment. Each employer shall post and keep posted in conspicuous places upon its premises where notices to employees and applicants for employment are customarily posted, a notice that shall be prepared or approved by the Commission and shall set forth (1) the definition of sexual harassment found in section 1604.11(a) of title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations (July 1, 1992), (2) the fact that sexual harassment in employment is a violation of title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, (3) information describing how to file with the Commission a complaint alleging such harassment, including information on the time periods within which an alleged victim of discrimination (including sexual harassment) must file a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, or a State or local fair employment agency, in order to satisfy the statute of limitations applicable to claims under title VII, (4) an address, and the tollfree telephone number, to be used to contact the Commission regarding such harassment or compliance with the requirements of this Act, and (5) such other information as the Commission may require. Such notice shall be provided in a manner that ensures that such employee actually receives such notice. The Congress finds the following: (1) Sexual harassment in employment persists widely in the workplace, although it violates title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and adversely affects employees. (2) According to guidelines issued by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 1980, the most effective tool for eliminating sexual harassment is prevention. (5) Sexual harassment has a significant cost for employees and employers. A 1988 study by Working Woman Magazine shows that sexual harassment costs a typical Fortune 500 employer $6,000,000, or $292.53 per employee, each year.
