With respect to birth defects prevention, the Committee shall (A) make recommendations regarding prevention research and intervention priorities; (B) study and recommend ways to prevent birth defects, with emphasis on emerging technologies; (C) identify annually the important areas of government and nongovernment cooperation needed to implement prevention strategies; (D) identify research and prevention strategies which would be successful in addressing birth defects disparities among the major Hispanic subgroups, non Hispanic whites, African Americans, Native Americans, and Asian Americans; and (E) review and recommend policies and guidance related to birth defects research and prevention. The Congress makes the following findings: (1) Birth defects are the leading cause of infant mortality, directly responsible for one out of every five infant deaths. (3) Birth defects threaten the lives of infants of all racial and ethnic backgrounds. (4) Birth defects can be caused by exposure to environmental hazards, adverse health conditions during pregnancy, or genetic mutations. Prevention efforts are slowed by lack of information about the number and causes of birth defects. Outbreaks of birth defects may go undetected because surveillance and research efforts are underdeveloped and poorly coordinated. The Secretary shall establish at least five regional birth defects monitoring and research programs for the purpose of collecting and analyzing information on the number, incidence, correlates, and causes of birth defects, to include information regarding gender and different racial and ethnic groups, including Hispanics, nonHispanic whites, African Americans, Native Americans, and Asian Americans.
