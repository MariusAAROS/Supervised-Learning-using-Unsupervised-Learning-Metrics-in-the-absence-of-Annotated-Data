The Advisory Committee shall review information and make recommendations to the Secretary concerning (A) the development and maintenance of the MS and Parkinson's disease national surveillance systems; (B) the use and coordination of existing databases that collect or maintain information on neurological diseases and disorders; (C) the type of information to be collected and stored in the systems; (D) the manner in which such data is to be collected; (E) the use and availability of such data including guidelines for such use; and (F) the application of MS and Parkinson's disease registry methodologies to benefit other neurological diseases and disorders, including analysis of how other neurological disease surveillance systems or registries can be developed, piloted, and implemented nationally utilizing the MS and Parkinson's disease national surveillance systems' process and structure. Not later than 1 year after receipt of the report described in subsection (c)(3), the Secretary, acting through the Director of the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry and in consultation with a national voluntary health organization with experience serving the population of individuals with multiple sclerosis (referred to in this section as `MS'), shall (A) develop a system to collect data on MS including information with respect to the incidence and prevalence of the disease in the United States; (B) establish a national surveillance system for the collection and storage of such data to include a populationbased registry of cases of MS in the United States; (C) assist in application of MS national surveillance system methodologies for the development, piloting, and implementation of a national Parkinson's disease national surveillance system under subsection (b); and (D) provide analysis regarding expansion of national disease surveillance systems for other neurological diseases and disorders utilizing the MS and Parkinson's disease national surveillance systems' process and structure. Not later than 1 year after the receipt of the report described in subsection (c)(3), the Secretary, acting through the Director of the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry and in consultation with a national voluntary health organization with experience serving the population of individuals with Parkinson's disease, shall (A) develop a system to collect data on Parkinson's disease including information with respect to the incidence and prevalence of the disease in the United States; (B) establish a national surveillance system for the collection and storage of such data to include a populationbased registry of cases of Parkinson's disease in the United States; and (C) provide analysis regarding expansion of national disease surveillance systems for other neurological diseases utilizing the MS and Parkinson's disease national surveillance systems' process and structure. (11) Better data are needed to understand the economic impact of Parkinson's disease, MS, and other neurological diseases. (15) Central nervous system drugs, including therapies for MS, Parkinson's disease, and other neurological diseases, are the slowest in the drug development pipeline, taking an average of 15 years post discovery for new therapies to reach the market. (17) A single national system to collect and store information on the incidence and prevalence of MS, Parkinson's disease, or other neurological diseases in the United States does not exist. (Q) Experts in additional neurological diseases, as appropriate, based on development and implementation of national surveillance systems for other neurological diseases and disorders.
