Notwithstanding any provision of any State or Federal law, after the date of the enactment of this Act, no creditor, servicer, or holder of such mortgage, or any other person acting on behalf of any such creditor, servicer, or holder, may take any action to initiate a foreclosure, whether judicial or nonjudicial, or any action in connection with a foreclosure already instituted other than to suspend such foreclosure, with respect to any eligible mortgage of a consumer, until the end of the 90day period beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act. The term `troubled assets' means (A) any residential mortgage, and any security, obligation, or other instrument that is based on or related to such mortgage (i) is in preforeclosure; (ii) with respect to which the borrower has missed at least 2 payments within the last 6 months; or (iii) which is in forbearance; or (B) any other financial instrument that the Secretary, after consultation with the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, determines the purchase of which is necessary to promote financial market stability, but only upon transmittal of such determination, in writing, to the appropriate committees of Congress. After the date of the enactment of this Act, any consumer shall have the right to defer any initiation of a foreclosure, whether judicial or nonjudicial, or any action in connection with a foreclosure already instituted, including any foreclosure sale, with respect to any eligible mortgage by any creditor, servicer, or holder of such mortgage, or any other person acting on behalf of any such creditor, servicer, or holder, until the end of the 90day period beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act. The Secretary is authorized to establish the Troubled Asset Restoration and Assistance Program (hereafter in this title referred to as the `TARAP') to allow the Treasury to purchase lender or servicer `losses' on rehabilitated mortgages, on such terms and conditions as are defined in this Act and determined by the Secretary. The term `rehabilitated mortgage' means a mortgage which has been restructured, refinanced or otherwise modified to lower the borrower's monthly payment (A) creating a frontend debt ratio, including the cost of mortgage principal, interest, taxes, and insurance, of no more than 30 percent of the gross monthly income of the borrower; or (B) to a term deemed affordable by the borrower after full disclosure by the lender and pursuant to rules as may be established by the Secretary.
