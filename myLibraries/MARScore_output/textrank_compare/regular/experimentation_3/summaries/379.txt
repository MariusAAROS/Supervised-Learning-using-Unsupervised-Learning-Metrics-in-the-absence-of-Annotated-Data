If there is further briefing following remand in the district court, such time limits shall run from the date on which a responsive brief is filed or, if no timely responsive brief is filed, the date on which such brief is due. In a case pending on the date of enactment of this Act, if the amendments made by this Act provide that a time limit runs from an event or time that has occurred prior to such date of enactment, the time limit shall run instead from such date of enactment. Section 2254(j) of title 28, United States Code, as added by section 2 of this Act, is further amended by adding at the end the following: (4) Time limits in district court. (B) Remand in district court. The court of appeals shall decide the appeal from an order granting or denying a writ of habeas corpus (i) not later than 120 days after the date on which the brief of the appellee is filed or, if no timely brief is filed, the date on which such brief is due; or (ii) if a crossappeal is filed, not later than 120 days after the date on which the appellant files a brief in response to the issues presented by the crossappeal or, if no timely brief is filed, the date on which such brief is due. If there is further briefing in the court of appeals, the time limit specified in paragraph (5)(B) shall run from the date on which a responsive brief is filed or, if no timely responsive brief is filed, from the date on which such brief is due.
