If as of the date specified in subsection (a) for the termination of the funding allocation formula referred to in that subsection the Secretary of Veterans Affairs has not implemented a replacement funding allocation formula in accordance with subsection (b), then effective as of that date and until such replacement funding allocation formula is implemented, the funding allocation formula to be applied to amounts appropriated for veterans medical care shall be the formula in effect before the formula referred to in subsection (a). Congress makes the following findings: (1) The Veterans Equitable Resource Allocation (VERA) formula, established by the Department of Veterans Affairs pursuant to section 429 of the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, 1997 (Public Law 104204; 110 Stat. 2929), has proved to be an ineffective means of allocating veterans medical care dollars fairly across the 22 national service regions, known as Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISNs), of the Department of Veterans Affairs. (4) The VERA formula should be replaced with a new funding formula that puts the funds provided to the Department of Veterans Affairs for medical care into the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Centers that are treating patients. The funding allocation formula for the Department of Veterans Affairs medical care system known as the Veterans Equitable Resource Allocation system, established pursuant to section 429 of the Department of Veterans Affairs pursuant to section 429 of the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, 1997 (Public Law 104204; 110 Stat. 2929), shall be discontinued by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs effective at the end of the fiscal year during which this Act is enacted. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall develop a new formula for the allocation of funds appropriated to the Department of Veterans Affairs for Medical Care to the national service regions, known as Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISNs), of the Department. There is authorized to be appropriated to the Department of Veterans Affairs for fiscal year 2004, $10,000,000 for development and implementation of a replacement funding allocation formula in accordance with section 3(b). There is authorized to be appropriated to the Department of Veterans Affairs for fiscal year 2004, $100,000,000 for Medical Care for the Department of Veterans Affairs.
