The Administrator shall, on an ongoing basis (1) review information on planned refinery outages and unplanned refinery outages (A) reported by refineries under subsection (b); and (B) that is available from commercial reporting services; (2) analyze that information to determine whether the scheduling of a planned refinery outage or an unplanned refinery outage may nationally or regionally substantially affect the price or supply of any refined petroleum product by (A) decreasing the production of the refined petroleum product; and (B) causing or contributing to a retail or wholesale supply shortage or disruption; and (3) alert the Secretary of any refinery outage that the Administrator determines may nationally or regionally substantially affect the price or supply of a refined petroleum product. On a determination by the Secretary that a refinery outage may affect the price or supply of a refined petroleum product, the Secretary shall make available to refinery operators information on planned refinery outages or unplanned refinery outages to prevent significant market disruptions. The report required under paragraph (1) shall include information on (A) the days of existing storage capabilities within the different petroleum administration defense districts based on normal usage of refined petroleum products; (B) the feasibility of increasing storage capacity for refined petroleum products on a regional basis; and (C) the impact additional storage capacity would have on the retail price of refined petroleum products for consumers in the event of a supply shortage or market disruption from a natural disaster or refinery outage. The owner or operator of a refinery shall submit to the Administrator information describing (1) the schedule of the refinery for any planned refinery outage, including (A) the dates for the planned refinery outage at least 1 year in advance of the date of the expected outage or the date the outage is scheduled; and (B) the estimated inventories and production of refined petroleum products during the period described in subparagraph (A); and (2) any unplanned refinery outages as soon as practicable (c) Review and Analysis of Available Information. Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this subsection, the Secretary shall study and submit to Congress a report on the costs and benefits of creating a national strategic refined petroleum products reserve for refined petroleum products.
