(5) The marketing of immature Hass avocados adversely affects demand for all Hass avocados because immature avocados are unpalatable and unfit for human consumption and, when marketed, result in dissatisfied customers who will cease purchasing Hass avocados. Subsection (a) and the regulations issued pursuant to subsection (a) shall not apply to Hass avocados (1) intended for consumption by charitable institutions; (2) intended for distribution by relief agencies; (3) intended for commercial processing into products; or (4) that the Secretary determines should not be subject to such subsection or such regulations. (4) The maintenance and expansion of markets in existence on the date of enactment of this Act, and the development of new or improved markets or uses for Hass avocados, are needed to preserve and strengthen the economic viability of the domestic Hass avocado industry for the benefit of producers, importers, and other persons associated with the producing, importing, marketing, processing, and consuming of Hass avocados. It is the purpose of this Act to set forth certain mandatory quality standards in the form of mandatory minimum maturity requirements for all Hass avocados, and to provide the Secretary with the authority necessary to ensure that such standards are met, with the intention of (1) strengthening the position of the Hass avocado industry in the domestic marketplace; and (2) maintaining, developing, and expanding markets and uses for Hass avocados. Congress finds the following: (1) Hass avocados are an integral food source in the United States that are a valuable and healthy part of the human diet and are enjoyed by millions of persons every year for a multitude of everyday and special occasions. (2) Hass avocados are a significant tree fruit crop grown by many individual producers both domestically and abroad. (3) Hass avocados move in interstate and foreign commerce and Hass avocados that do not move in interstate or foreign channels of commerce but only in intrastate commerce directly affect interstate commerce of Hass avocados.
