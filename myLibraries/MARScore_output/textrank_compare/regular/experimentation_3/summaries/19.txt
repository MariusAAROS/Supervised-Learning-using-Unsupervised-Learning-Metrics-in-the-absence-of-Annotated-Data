At the beginning of each fiscal year (beginning with fiscal year 2010), there shall be added to the DSH redistribution pool an amount equal to the amount by which (i) the total of the DSH allotments for all States for the third preceding fiscal year; exceeded (ii) the total Federal financial participation under this title attributable to such allotments for such fiscal year. To carry out this subsection there is hereby made available for each fiscal year (beginning with fiscal year 2010 and ending with fiscal year 2014) and appropriated from the DSH redistribution pool established under subsection (d)(7), an amount equal to (i) the amount available for obligation from such pool in such fiscal year, reduced by (ii) the Secretary's estimate of the aggregate increase in Federal financial participation under this title for the fiscal year that will be attributable to the amendments made by section 2(b) of the Strengthening the Health Care Safety Net Act of 2009. At the beginning of each fiscal year (beginning with fiscal year 2011), there shall be subtracted from the DSH redistribution pool an amount equal to the sum of (i) the aggregate increase in Federal financial participation under this title attributable to the amendments made by section 2(b) of the Strengthening the Health Care Safety Net Act of 2009 for the previous fiscal year; and (ii) the amount obligated on grants under subsection (k) for such previous fiscal year.

Such amount shall be determined by the Secretary at the beginning of each fiscal year and the Secretary may adjust such amount in subsequent fiscal years to take into account errors in estimates made for previous fiscal years. The amount in such pool shall be available for obligation and expenditure without fiscal year limitation. Subsection (f)(5) of such section is amended (1) in subparagraph (B) (A) by striking and at the end of clause (ii); (B) in clause (iii) (i) by striking 2009 and inserting 2015; (ii) by inserting , subject to subparagraph (D), after shall be; and (iii) by redesignating such clause as clause (iv); and (C) by inserting after clause (ii) the following new clause: (iii) each succeeding fiscal year before fiscal year 2015 shall be, subject to subparagraph (D), the DSH allotment for the State for the previous fiscal year increased by 16 percent; and; and (2) by adding at the end the following new subparagraphs: (C) Additional states covered for fiscal year 2010 and subsequent years.
