(B) Funds provided by the Administrator under subparagraph (A) may not be used by States for purposes of providing financial assistance to an owner or operator in meeting the requirements respecting underground storage tanks contained in section 280.21 of title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (as in effect on the date of the enactment of this subsection) or similar requirements in State programs approved under this section or similar State or local provisions. In the case of a State that the Administrator has entered into a cooperative agreement with under section 9003(h)(7)(A), the Administrator shall distribute funds from the Trust Fund to the State using the allocation process developed by the Administrator for such cooperative agreements. (v) Corrective action and compensation programs under subsection (c)(1) for releases from underground storage tanks regulated under this subtitle in any instance, as determined by the State, in which the financial resources of an owner or operator, excluding resources provided by programs under subsection (c)(1), are not adequate to pay for the cost of a corrective action without significantly impairing the ability of the owner or operator to continue in business. The Administrator may revise such allocation process only after (i) consulting with State agencies responsible for overseeing corrective action for releases from underground storage tanks and with representatives of owners and operators; and (ii) taking into consideration, at a minimum, the total revenue received from each State into the Trust Fund, the number of confirmed releases from leaking underground storage tanks in each State, the number of notified petroleum storage tanks in each State, and the percent of the population of each State using groundwater for any beneficial purpose. The Administrator shall distribute to States at least 85 percent of the funds appropriated to the Environmental Protection Agency from the Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund (in this subsection referred to as the `Trust Fund') each fiscal year for the reasonable costs under cooperative agreements entered into with the Administrator for the following: (i) States' actions under section 9003(h)(7)(A). Funds provided to States from the Trust Fund to owners or operators for programs under subsection (c)(1) for releases from underground storage tanks are not subject to cost recovery by the Administrator under section 9003(h)(6). (iii) Enforcement of a State or local program approved under this section or enforcement of this subtitle or similar State or local provisions by a State or local government.
