The term COBRA continuation coverage means continuation coverage provided pursuant to title XXII of the Public Health Service Act, section 4980B of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (other than subsection (f)(1) of such section insofar as it relates to pediatric vaccines), part 6 of subtitle B of title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (other than under section 609), section 8905a of title 5, United States Code, or under a State program that provides continuation coverage comparable to such continuation coverage. A State providing premium assistance under this section shall be entitled to payment under section 1903(a) of the Social Security Act with respect to such assistance (and administrative expenses relating to such assistance) in the same manner as such State is entitled to payment with respect to medical assistance (and such administrative expenses) under such section, except that, for purposes of this subsection, any reference to the Federal medical assistance percentage shall be deemed a reference to the enhanced FMAP (as defined in section 2105(b) of such Act). The provisions of subsections (c)(5) and (c)(6) of section 3 shall apply with respect to this section in the same manner as it applies under such section. For purposes of this section, a qualified individual is an individual who (A) establishes that the individual (i) on or after July 1, 2001, became entitled to elect COBRA continuation coverage; and (ii) has elected such coverage; and (B) enrolls in the premium assistance program under this section by not later than the end of such 1year period. Premium assistance provided under this section shall be credited by such administrator (or other entity) against the premium otherwise owed by the individual involved for such coverage. In the case of notices provided under section 4980B(f)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 with respect to individuals who, on or after July 1, 2001, become entitled to elect COBRA continuation coverage, such notices shall include an additional notification to the recipient of the availability of premium assistance for such coverage under this section. For purposes of this paragraph, such coverage under subparagraph (A) or (B) shall not include coverage consisting solely of coverage of excepted benefits (as defined in section 2791(c) of the Public Health Service Act).
