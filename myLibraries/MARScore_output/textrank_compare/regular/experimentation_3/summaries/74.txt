No portion of the unused business credit which is attributable to the credit determined under section 45C (relating to distressed area building credit) may be carried to any taxable year ending before January 1, 1996. The term `applicable percentage' means the appropriate percentage prescribed by the Secretary for the earlier of (A) the month in which such building is placed in service, or (B) at the election of the taxpayer (i) the month in which the taxpayer and the credit allocating agency enter into an agreement with respect to such building (which is binding on such agency, the taxpayer, and all successors in interest) as to the building credit dollar amount to be allocated to such building, or (ii) in the case of any building to which the rules of section 42(h)(4)(B) apply, the month in which the taxexempt obligations are issued. The amount of the credit determined under this section for any taxable year with respect to any building shall not exceed the distressed area building credit dollar amount allocated to such building under this subsection. Any distressed area building credit dollar amount allocated to any building for any calendar year (A) shall apply to such building for all taxable years in the credit period ending during or after such calendar year, and (B) shall reduce the aggregate distressed area building credit dollar amount of the credit allocating agency only for such calendar year. (A) the taxable year, and calendar year, in which such building was placed in service, (B) the adjusted basis and eligible basis of such building as of the close of the 1st year of the credit period, (C) the maximum applicable percentage and eligible basis permitted to be taken into account by the appropriate credit allocating agency, and (D) such other information as the Secretary may require. In the case of a failure to make the certification required by the preceding sentence on the date prescribed therefor, unless it is shown that such failure is due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect, no credit shall be allowable by reason of subsection (a) with respect to such building for any taxable year ending before such certification is made. The Secretary may require taxpayers and credit allocating agencies to submit such reports as the Secretary determines necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of this section.
