The Secretary may establish a system for recapturing and redistributing amounts provided to public housing agencies under this subsection, which shall (A) provide for the recapture of such amounts only from an agency that, in the determination of the Secretary pursuant to a review under subsection (e)(4)(B) or an audit under subsection (e)(4)(C), has not made reasonable progress in carrying out modernization projects approved by the Secretary under the comprehensive plan for the agency under subsection (d)(4) or (e); (B) provide for the redistribution of such recaptured amounts for use by other public housing agencies that, in the determination of the Secretary, need such amounts to carry out the comprehensive plans for such agencies and are capable of using such amounts in a timely manner; (C) provide for redistribution to the agencies referred to in subparagraph (B) based on an allocation system that takes into consideration the formula established pursuant to subsection (k)(2)(A); and (D) establish an annual schedule for redistribution of amounts recaptured. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall conduct a study to determine the efficiency of the procedures and requirements applicable to procurement by public housing agencies of materials, supplies, systems, appliances, labor, and services used in maintaining, operating, and modernizing public housing projects. Under the study, the Secretary shall (1) compare the existing procurement system for public housing agencies to (A) a system of procurement under which public housing agencies procure materials, supplies, systems, appliances, labor, and services for use in maintaining, operating, and modernizing public housing projects without being subject to any requirements established by the Secretary or any other Federal laws or regulations regarding procurement; and (B) a system of procurement that operates in the manner described under subparagraph (A), except that under such system the Secretary would annually review the procurement policies and actions of each public housing agency for the preceding year and would have the authority to establish limitations on procurement policies and activities determined by the Secretary to have instituted inappropriate procurement policies or engaged in inappropriate procurement activities; (2) determine the advantages and disadvantages of procurement pursuant to the existing procurement system for public housing agencies and the systems referred to in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (1); and (3) determine the effect of the requirements under section 12 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (relating to labor standards) on the affordability of dwelling units in public housing. The provisions of any applicable State and local laws shall apply to any public housing agency, resident management corporation, and public housing project with respect to which authority is granted under subsection (a).
