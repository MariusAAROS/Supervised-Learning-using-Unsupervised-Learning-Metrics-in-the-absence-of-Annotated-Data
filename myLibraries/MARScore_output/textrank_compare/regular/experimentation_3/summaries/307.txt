Beginning with plan year 2015, except as provided in subparagraph (C), an MA organization offering an MA plan may only remove a provider of services or a supplier from a network of such plan if the organization has cause to remove such provider or supplier. An MA organization offering an MA plan has cause to remove a provider of services or a supplier from a network of such plan if the Secretary determines that the provider or supplier is (I) medically negligent; (II) in violation of any legal or contractual requirement applicable to the provider or supplier acting within the lawful scope of practice, including any participation or other requirement applicable to such provider or supplier under this title or under any contractual term for such plan; or (III) otherwise unfit to furnish items and services in accordance with requirements of this title. For purposes of subparagraph (A), cost to an MA organization offering an MA plan due to the participation of a provider of services or supplier in a network of such plan does not constitute cause for the MA organization to remove such provider or supplier from the network, and such cost may not be considered as a factor in favor of a determination that such organization has cause to remove the provider. In addition to providing the notification of removal as required under clause (i), the MA organization offering such MA plan shall include such notification in the annual notice of change for the MA plan for the upcoming plan year. (ii) Other information related to the establishment or modification of such provider network that the Secretary determines appropriate. With respect to each upcoming plan year, beginning with plan year 2015, an MA organization offering an MA plan may only remove a provider of services or supplier from a network of such plan for reasons not specified in subparagraph (B)(i) before the date that is 60 days before the first day of the annual coordinated election period for such plan year under section 1851(e)(3). Not less than 60 days before the date on which a provider of services or supplier is removed from a network of an MA plan, the MA organization offering such plan shall provide notification of the removal to each individual enrolled in such plan receiving items or services from the provider or supplier during the plan year in effect on the date of removal or during the previous plan year.
