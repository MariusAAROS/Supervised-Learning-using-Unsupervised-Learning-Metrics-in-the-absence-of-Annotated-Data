regarding prescription drug coverage under part D of title XVIII of such Act. The protocol developed under subparagraph (A) shall include for the monitoring of the following information with respect to such full benefit dual eligible individuals: (i) Emergency room visit rates. (2) The transition of 6,400,000 dual eligibles from prescription drug coverage under the medicaid program to prescription drug coverage under part D of the medicare program is the largest transition ever of individuals from one insurance program to another. (5) Since even a shortterm gap in prescription drug coverage could have serious health consequences for dual eligibles, Congress must work to guarantee as smooth a transition as possible for dual eligibles so that no dual eligible is without prescription drug coverage even for one day. Nothing in subsection (a) shall be construed as limiting the authority or responsibility of a State under section 1902(a)(25) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(25)) to seek reimbursement from a prescription drug plan, an MAPD plan, or any other third party, of the costs incurred by the State in providing prescription drug coverage described in such subsection. REGARDING PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE AND MONITORING OF THE TRANSITION OF DUAL ELIGIBLES TO PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE UNDER MEDICARE.
