The purpose of this Act is to promote health and prevent disease, particularly diseases related to being overweight and obese, by (1) encouraging healthier lifestyles; (2) providing financial incentives to ease the financial burden of engaging in healthy behavior; and (3) increasing the ability of individuals and families to participate in physical fitness activities. Amounts paid for equipment described in subparagraph (A)(iii) shall be treated as a qualified sports and fitness expense only (i) if such equipment is utilized exclusively for participation in fitness, exercise, sport, or other physical activity programs, (ii) if such equipment is not apparel or footwear, and (iii) in the case of any item of sports equipment (other than exercise equipment), with respect to so much of the amount paid for such item as does not exceed $250. For purposes of subparagraph (A)(i), the term `fitness facility' means a facility (i) providing instruction in a program of physical exercise, offering facilities for the preservation, maintenance, encouragement, or development of physical fitness, or serving as the site of such a program of a State or local government, (ii) which is not a private club owned and operated by its members, (iii) which does not offer golf, hunting, sailing, or riding facilities, (iv) whose health or fitness facility is not incidental to its overall function and purpose, and (v) which is fully compliant with the State of jurisdiction and Federal anti discrimination laws. Congress finds that (1) almost 20 percent of American children between the ages of 2 and 19 are overweight or suffer from obesity; (2) 8 of the 9 most expensive illnesses in the United States are more common among overweight and obese individuals; (3) according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the increase in the number of overweight and obese Americans between 1987 and 2001 resulted in a 27 percent increase in per capita health care costs; (4) the World Health Organization determined that in the United States a $1 investment in physical activity alone (in time and equipment) would reduce medical expenses by $3.20; (5) research indicates that 2 in 5 Americans would become more physically active if offered a financial incentive; (6) the United States ranks last in the world in reducing the number of preventable deaths resulting from obesityrelated chronic illnesses; and (7) engaging in physical activities at young ages when children are learning lifelong behaviors can have a significant impact on their longterm health.
