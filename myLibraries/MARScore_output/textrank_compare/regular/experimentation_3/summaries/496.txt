The regulations under this subsection shall (A) identify specific requirements to prevent the overclassification of information, including for determining (i) when classified products should be prepared in a similar format governmentwide; and (ii) when classified products should also be prepared in an unclassified format; taking into consideration whether an unclassified product would reasonably be expected to be of any benefit to a State, local, tribal or territorial government, law enforcement agency, or other emergency response provider, the private sector, or the public; (B) ensure that compliance with this Act protects national security and privacy rights; and (C) establish requirements for Federal agencies to implement, subject to chapter 71 of title 5, United States Code, including the following: (i) The process whereby an individual may challenge without retribution classification decisions by another individual and be rewarded with specific incentives for successful challenges resulting in (I) the removal of improper classification markings; or (II) the correct application of appropriate classification markings. When implementing the security education and training program pursuant to Executive Order 12958, Executive Order 12829, and successor appropriate Executive Orders, the Archivist, subject to chapter 71 of title 5, United States Code, shall, in consultation with heads of affected Federal agencies (1) integrate training to educate about (A) the prevention of overclassification of information; (B) the proper use of classification markings, including portion markings; (C) the consequences of overclassification and other repeated improper uses of classification markings, including the misapplication of classification markings to information that does not merit such markings, and of failing to comply with the policies and procedures established under or pursuant to this section, including the negative consequences for the individual's personnel evaluation, information sharing, and the overall success of the agency's missions; and (D) information relating to lessons learned from implementation of the regulations including affected Federal agency internal audits and Inspector General audits, as provided under this Act; and (2) ensure that such program is conducted efficiently, in conjunction with any other security, intelligence, or other training programs required by the agency to reduce the costs and administrative burdens associated with the additional training required by this section. For purposes described in paragraph (2), the Archivist of the United States shall require that, at the time of classification of information, the following shall appear on the information: (A) The name, personal identifier, or unique agency identifier of the individual applying classification markings to the information. The Archivist of the United States, in consultation with the heads of affected Federal agencies, shall promulgate regulations to prevent the overclassification of information. The Archivist, subject to chapter 71 of title 5, United States Code, in consultation with heads of affected Federal agencies, shall implement a detailee program to detail Federal agency personnel, on a nonreimbursable basis, to the National Archives and Records Administration for the purpose of (A) training and educational benefit for the agency personnel assigned so that they may better understand the policies, procedures and laws governing classification authorities; (B) bolstering the ability of the National Archives and Records Administration to conduct its oversight authorities over agencies; and (C) ensuring that the policies and procedures established by the agencies remain consistent with those established by the Archivist of the United States.
