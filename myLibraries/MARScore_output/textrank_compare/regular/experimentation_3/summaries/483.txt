(7) The October 2005 report of the Comptroller General found that the Attorney General, who provides technical assistance in the drafting of antiterrorist financing legislation for priority countries, concluded that having procedures and practices for Terrorist Financing Working Group priority countries that differ from those for other vulnerable countries creates problems. (3) The Terrorist Financing Working Group, an interagency entity established by the National Security Council and chaired by the Secretary of State, coordinates the delivery of training and technical assistance to nearly two dozen countries the Working Group considers to be priority countries, as well as to other countries the Working Group considers to be nonpriority countries, that are vulnerable to terrorist financing. The coordination of funding and resources for counterterrorism financing and antimoney laundering training and technical assistance delivered to all countries (without regard to whether any country is designated as a priority country or a nonpriority country by the Terrorist Financing Working Group), including the means for providing a transparent assessment of United States Government resources and a method for aligning those resources with the needs of vulnerable countries. (9) In connection with this disagreement, the Secretary of State and the Attorney General believe that legislative drafting should be conducted by officials of the Department of Justice, while the Secretary of the Treasury, in some instances, advocated the use of contractors for nonpriority countries. SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the Counter Terrorism Financing Coordination Act.
