Congress finds that (1) inorganic arsenic compounds, such as chromated copper arsenate (referred to in this Act as CCA), are used as wood preservatives; (2) according to the Environmental Protection Agency (A) inorganic arsenic is a human poison; (B) exposure to inorganic arsenic may be fatal; and (C) at low levels, inorganic arsenic exposure may cause (i) nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea; (ii) decreased production of red and white blood cells; (iii) abnormal heart rhythm; and (iv) blood vessel damage; (3) the Department of Health and Human Services has determined that arsenic is a known carcinogen; (4) breathing inorganic arsenic increases the risk of lung cancer; (5) ingesting inorganic arsenic increases the risk of skin cancer and tumors of the bladder, kidney, liver, and lung; (6) to protect against health risks associated with the use of CCA, CCA is classified as a restricted use chemical; (7) as a restricted use chemical, CCA may be purchased and used only by a certified applicator (or a person under the direct supervision of a certified applicator) whose certification specifically covers the purchase and use of CCA; (8) individuals who use arsenic to treat wood are required to wear (A) protective clothing; and (B) a respirator, if the level of arsenic in the ambient air of the workplace of the individual (i) is unknown; or (ii) exceeds the permissible exposure limit of 10 micrograms per cubic meter of air averaged over an 8hour workday, as required under standards established by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration; (9) producers of pressuretreated wood are required to provide consumer information sheets to all lumber yards and other retailers of treated wood products; (10) those information sheets provide instructions on how consumers should handle treated wood products, such as instructions on the use of protective gloves, coveralls, and face masks when sawing treated wood products; and (11) because many consumers in the United States are unaware of the dangers of mishandling arsenictreated wood, an appropriate consumer warning label should be affixed to each piece of arsenictreated wood sold in the United States. Each piece of arsenictreated wood offered for sale in the United States shall have affixed to the piece of wood a consumer warning label that displays each of the following statements (or substantially similar statements, as determined by the Secretary): (1) `This piece of wood has been treated with arsenic.'. 3. LABELING OF ARSENICTREATED WOOD. LABELING OF ARSENICTREATED WOOD. (4) `To avoid the health risks associated with mishandling arsenictreated wood, you must wear gloves, goggles, coveralls, and face masks when working with it.'. (5) `Wash exposed body areas thoroughly with soap and water after working with arsenictreated wood.'. Not later than 60 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary, shall submit to Congress a report that (1) provides an update on the status of any ongoing review by the Environmental Protection Agency of the health risks associated with exposure to arsenic (including an estimated date of completion of the review); and (2) includes recommendations for interim guidelines, pending the completion of the review described in paragraph (1), for the use of arsenictreated wood in public and recreational facilities (including parks and playground equipment).
