The Secretary may approve a project proposal under this section if the project will help recover and sustain viable populations of flagship species in the wild by assisting efforts in foreign countries to implement flagship species conservation programs. To the maximum extent practicable, in determining whether to approve project proposals under this section, the Secretary shall give preference to conservation projects that are designed to ensure effective, longterm conservation of flagship species and their nesting habitats. (5) A new grant program modeled on the existing programs for tigers, rhinoceroses, elephants, great apes, neotropical migratory birds, and marine turtles would provide an effective means to assist in the conservation of flagship species for which there are no existing grant programs. The purpose of this Act is to conserve flagship species of fauna throughout the world, and the ecosystems on which those species depend, by supporting the conservation programs for those species and the CITES Secretariat, promoting partnerships between the public and private sectors, and providing financial resources for those programs and partnerships. To assist in carrying out this Act, the Secretary may convene an advisory group consisting of individuals representing public and private organizations actively involved in the conservation of flagship species. Not later than October 1, 2005, the Secretary shall submit to the Congress a report on the results and effectiveness of the program carried out under this Act, including (1) recommendations concerning how this Act might be improved, including guidelines for determining species that are flagship species; and (2) recommendations concerning whether the Fund should be continued in the future. A project proposal shall include (A) the name of the individual with primary responsibility for conducting the project; (B) a succinct statement of (i) the purposes of the project and the methodology for implementing the project, including an assessment of the status of the flagship species that is the subject of the project; and (ii) how the project will benefit that species and other species that reside within the same habitat; (C) a description of the qualifications of the individuals who will conduct the project; (D) an estimate of the funds and time required to complete the project; (E) evidence of support for the project by appropriate governmental entities of countries in which the project will be conducted, if the Secretary determines that such support is required for the success of the project; (F) information regarding the source and amount of matching funds available for the project; and (G) any other information that the Secretary considers to be necessary for evaluating the eligibility of the project for funding under this Act.
