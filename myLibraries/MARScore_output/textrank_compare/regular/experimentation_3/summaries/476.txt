It is also the policy of Congress, and the purpose of this Act, to provide for the establishment, use, and enforcement of a consistent and comprehensive system for labeling violent content in audio and visual media products (including labeling of such products in the advertisements for such products), whereby (1) the public may be adequately informed of (A) the nature, context, and intensity of depictions of violence in audio and visual media products; and (B) matters needed to judge the appropriateness of the purchase, viewing, listening to, use, or other consumption of audio and visual media products containing violent content by minors of various ages; and (2) the public may be assured of (A) the accuracy and consistency of the system in labeling the nature, context, and intensity of depictions of violence in audio and visual media products; and (B) the accuracy and consistency of the system in providing information on matters needed to judge the appropriateness of the purchase, viewing, listening to, use, or other consumption of audio and visual media products containing violent content by minors of various ages. Manufacturers and producers of interactive video game products and services, video program products, motion picture products, and sound recording products may submit to the Federal Trade Commission a joint proposal for a system for labeling the violent content in interactive video game products and services, video program products, motion picture products, and sound recording products. A system for labeling the violent content in interactive video game products and services, video program products, motion picture products, and sound recording products under this section shall meet the following requirements: (1) The label of a product or service shall consist of a single label which (A) takes into account the nature, context, and intensity of the depictions of violence in the product or service; and (B) assesses the totality of all depictions of violence in the product or service. Commencing one year after the date of the enactment of the Media Violence Labeling Act of 1999, a person may not manufacture or produce for sale or distribution in commerce, package for sale or distribution in commerce, or sell or distribute in commerce any interactive video game product or service, video program product, motion picture product, or sound recording product unless the product or service bears a label in accordance with the labeling system issued or prescribed by the Federal Trade Commission under subsection (d) which (1) is appropriate for the nature, context, and intensity of the depictions of violence in the product or service; and (2) specifies an appropriate minimum age in years for purchasers and consumers of the product or service. Commencing one year after the date of the enactment of the Media Violence Labeling Act of 1999, a person may not sell in commerce an interactive video game product or service, video program product, motion picture product, or sound recording product to an individual whose age in years is less than the age specified as the minimum age in years for a purchaser and consumer of the product or service, as the case may be, under the labeling system issued or prescribed by the Federal Trade Commission under subsection (d). The Federal Trade Commission shall have the authority to receive and investigate allegations that an interactive video game product or service, video program product, motion picture product, or sound recording product does not bear a label under the labeling system issued or prescribed by the Commission under subsection (d) that is appropriate for the product or service, as the case may be, given the nature, context, and intensity of the depictions of violence in the product or service. In the case of an interactive video game product or service, video program product, motion picture product, or sound recording product determined to violate section 4A(e), each day from the date of the commencement of sale or distribution of the product or service, as the case may be, to the date of the determination of the violation shall constitute a separate violation of subsection (a), and all such violations shall be aggregated together for purposes of determining the total liability of the manufacturer or producer of the product or service, as the case may be, for such violations under that subsection.
