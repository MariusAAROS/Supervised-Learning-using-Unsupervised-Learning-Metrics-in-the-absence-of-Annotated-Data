A prescription drug plan shall, in the case of receipt of a notice pursuant to subparagraph (D) related to an enrollee for whom a primary drug plan has reported on ongoing responsibility for medical costs pursuant to paragraph (7) or (8) of section 1862(b), authorize the provider of such covered part D drug to charge, in accordance with the charges allowed under the prescription drug plan, such primary drug plan for such covered part D drug related to or arising out of the treatment accident or injury subject to such notice (other than payments subject to a claim under subparagraph (B) or (F)) for the period in which the enrollee remains enrolled in such plan through the date upon which such primary drug plan has terminated such ongoing responsibility for medical payments. Not later than 15 days after the date the Secretary receives information under paragraph (7) or (8) of section 1862(b) relating to an individual enrolled in a prescription drug plan during an applicable time, the Secretary shall provide such information to such prescription drug plan in a format convenient and accessible to such plans. A prescription drug plan shall be secondary payor to any valid and collectible payment from a primary drug plan (as defined in clause (iv)) until such time as such primary drug plan pays a final settlement, judgment, or award to an individual enrolled under the prescription drug plan with regard to an injury or illness involved or otherwise terminates its ongoing responsibility for medical payments with respect to the individual. (ii) Limitation on parties making prescription drug plans primary. A subrogation claim may not be asserted pursuant to this subparagraph by a prescription drug plan with respect to a payment for a covered part D drug after the date that is 3 years after the date such plan receives notice of a payment, with respect to such covered part D drug, pursuant to subparagraph (D).
