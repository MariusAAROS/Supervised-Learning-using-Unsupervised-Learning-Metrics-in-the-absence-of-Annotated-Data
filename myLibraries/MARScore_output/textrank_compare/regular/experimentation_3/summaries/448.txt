The regulations under section 4(a) shall include provisions, consistent with the order of precedence set forth in section 8342(c) of title 5, United States Code, under which a survivor of an individual who performed service described in section 8332(b)(18) of such title (as amended by section 1) shall be allowed to submit an application on behalf of and to receive any lump sum payment that would otherwise have been payable to the decedent under subsection (b) or (c). For purposes of any application for any benefit which is computed or recomputed taking into account any service described in section 8332(b)(18) of title 5, United States Code (as amended by section 1), section 8345(i)(2) of such title shall be applied by deeming the reference to the date of the other event which gives rise to title to the benefit to refer to the effective date of this Act, if later than the date of the event that would otherwise apply. Any individual (not described in subsection (b)) who becomes eligible for an annuity or for an increased annuity as a result of the enactment of this Act may elect to have such individual's rights under subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5, United States Code, determined as if the amendments made by this Act had been in effect, throughout all periods of service on the basis of which such annuity is or would be based, by submitting an appropriate application to the Office of Personnel Management within 2 years after (A) the effective date of this Act; or (B) if later, the date on which such individual separates from service. Any entitlement to an annuity or to an increased annuity resulting from an application under paragraph (1) shall be effective as of the commencement date of such annuity (subject to subparagraph (B), if applicable), and any amounts becoming payable for periods before the first month for which regular monthly annuity payments begin to be made in accordance with the amendments made by this Act shall be payable to such individual in the form of a lumpsum payment. Any individual who is entitled to an annuity for the month in which this Act becomes effective may, upon application submitted to the Office of Personnel Management within 2 years after the effective date of this Act, have the amount of such annuity recomputed as if the amendments made by this Act had been in effect throughout all periods of service on the basis of which such annuity is or may be based. Any determination of the amount, or of the commencement date, of any annuity, all the requirements for entitlement to which (including separation, but disregarding any application requirement) would have been satisfied before the effective date of this Act if this Act had then been in effect (but would not then otherwise have been satisfied absent this Act) shall be made as if application for such annuity had been submitted as of the earliest date that would have been allowable, after such individual's separation from service, if such amendments had been in effect throughout the periods of service referred to in the first sentence of paragraph (1). Section 8332(b) of title 5, United States Code, is amended (1) by striking and at the end of paragraph (16); (2) by striking the period at the end of paragraph (17) and inserting ; and; (3) by adding after paragraph (17) the following: (18) any period of service performed before 1977, while a citizen of the United States, in the employ of Air America, Incorporated, Air Asia Company Limited (a subsidiary of Air America, Incorporated), or the Pacific Division of Southern Air Transport, Incorporated, at a time when that corporation (or subsidiary) was owned or controlled by the Government of the United States and operated or managed by the Central Intelligence Agency.; and (4) by adding at the end the following: For purposes of this subchapter, service of the type described in paragraph (18) of this subsection shall be considered to have been service as an employee, and the Office of Personnel Management shall accept the certification of the Director of Central Intelligence or his designee concerning any such service.
