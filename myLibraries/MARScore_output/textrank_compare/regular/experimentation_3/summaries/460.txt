(3) A political party shall be treated as a qualified political party for purposes of paragraph (2)(A) if the candidate for President of such party in the most recent presidential election received more than 5 percent of the total number of votes cast by individuals for that office, except that, in the case of any political party whose candidate (as described in subparagraph (A) or (B)) received less than 33\1/3\ percent of such total votes, the amount of free broadcast time required to be allotted under clause (i) or (ii) of paragraph (2)(A) shall be reduced by 0.4 hours for each percent of such vote received that is less than 33\1/3\ percent. (5) Nothing in this subsection, and no use of free broadcast time allotted under this subsection, shall be construed to restrict or otherwise affect the purchase of advertising time under subsection (b) of this section.
