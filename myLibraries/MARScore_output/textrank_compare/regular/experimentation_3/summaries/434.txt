The notice shall include a copy of the complaint to be filed to initiate such civil action, except that if it is not feasible for the State to provide such prior notice, the State shall provide notice immediately upon instituting such civil action. (c) Intervention by FTC.Upon receiving the notice required by subsection (b), the Commission may intervene in such civil action and upon intervening (1) be heard on all matters arising in such civil action; (2) remove the action to the appropriate United States district court; and (3) file petitions for appeal of a decision in such civil action.
