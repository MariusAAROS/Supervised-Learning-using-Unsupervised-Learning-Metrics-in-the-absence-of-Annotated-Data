The Secretary of Transportation shall (1) finalize the revision of the Handbook for publication on or before the date required for issuance of regulations in section 102; (2) initiate a review of applicable traffic safety research for purposes of incorporating in the Handbook appropriate recommendations relating to (A) supplemental lighting at intersections, interchanges, railgrade rail crossings and hazardous sections of roadways, as appropriate, to address visual impairments among older drivers; (B) wetnight visibility of pavement markings and edgelines; and (C) design of intersection curbs and curb ramps to address physical limitations of older or disabled pedestrians; (3) issue, not later than one year after the date of enactment of this section, a guidance memo regarding the appropriateness of applying to public roads and highways pedestrian safety improvements relating to the following intersection design elements: (A) receiving lane (throat) width for turning operations; (B) channelization; (C) offset (single) leftturn lane geometry, signing, and delineation; (D) curb radius; and (E) pedestrian crossing design, operations, and control; and (4) conduct ongoing research to permit revision and publication of an updated Handbook not later than December 31, 2014. TITLE IROADWAY SAFETY ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM FOR OLDER DRIVERS AND PEDESTRIANS SEC. ROADWAY SAFETY ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM FOR OLDER DRIVERS AND PEDESTRIANS. The Secretary of Transportation shall establish and implement a program, the roadway safety enhancement program for older drivers and pedestrians, to improve roadway safety infrastructure in all States in a manner consistent with the recommendations included in the publication of the Federal Highway Administration entitled Highway Design Handbook for Older Drivers and Pedestrians (FHWARD01103), referred to in this Act as the Handbook, dated May 2001 or as subsequently revised and updated pursuant to section 103. The purpose of the roadway safety enhancement program for older drivers and pedestrians is to achieve a significant reduction in roadway fatalities and serious injuries among drivers and pedestrians 65 years of age or older on all public roads. A State may obligate funds apportioned to the State under subsection (c) for the planning, design, and construction of infrastructurerelated projects that employ safety enhancement recommendations set forth in the Handbook (A) to improve safety at intersections, interchanges, rail grade crossings, and roadway segments; (B) to make systemic roadway safety improvements on public roads; and (C) to improve roadway safety on other sections or elements of public roads that a State transportation department identifies as hazardous for older drivers and pedestrians. To obligate funds apportioned under subsection (c) to carry out this section, a State shall have in effect, either in conjunction with a State strategic highway safety plan pursuant to section 148 of title 23, United States Code, or separately, appropriate policies and procedures developed by the State transportation department to (A) analyze and make effective use of State, regional and local crash and fatality data, hospital reports and other data to document trafficrelated fatalities and injuries to individuals 65 years of age or older; (B) consult with appropriate State and local transportation planning agencies, State and local safety agencies and organizations, representatives of the roadway infrastructure safety industry, and State and local organizations representing older drivers and pedestrians, to identify hazardous locations, sections, and elements of public roads that constitute a danger for drivers, vehicle occupants, or pedestrians 65 years of age or older; (C) determine the relative severity of hazardous road and highway locations, sections and elements for drivers and pedestrians age 65 years or older through crash and injury data analysis; (D) establish priorities for obligating funds among potential projects for correction of hazardous road and highway conditions, which shall include projects that (i) involve hazardous intersection, road or highway conditions identified in a strategic highway safety plan pursuant to section 148(c)(1)(D) as exhibiting the most severe safety needs; (ii) make use of multiple Handbook recommendations or the use of a systemic program to correct the most serious highway safety hazards for drivers or pedestrians 65 years of age or older; or (iii) are used in conjunction with other Federal programs such as the safe routes to schools program pursuant to section 1404 of SAFETEALU or such other road safety design improvements or funding that enhance traffic and pedestrian safety for all roadway users; (E) establish and implement a schedule of roadway infrastructure safety improvement projects for hazard correction and hazard prevention; and (F) establish an evaluation process to analyze and assess results achieved by highway safety improvement projects carried out in accordance with procedures and criteria established by the section and report annually the results of such evaluations to the Secretary.
