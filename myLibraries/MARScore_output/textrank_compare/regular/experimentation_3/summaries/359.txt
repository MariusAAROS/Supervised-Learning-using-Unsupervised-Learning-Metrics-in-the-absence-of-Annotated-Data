In the case of a previously uninsured individual, there shall be allowed as a credit against the tax imposed by this subtitle for the taxable year an amount equal to the amount paid by the taxpayer during such taxable year for health insurance coverage for the taxpayer and the taxpayer's spouse and dependents. In the case of an employee who is covered by a new health plan of the employer for only a portion of such taxable year, the limitation under the preceding sentence shall be an amount which bears the same ratio to such limitation (determined without regard to this sentence) as such portion bears to the entire taxable year. No deduction shall be allowed for that portion of the expenses (otherwise allowable as a deduction) taken into account in determining the credit under section 45O for the taxable year which is equal to the amount of the credit determined for such taxable year under section 45O(a). The amount which would (but for this paragraph) be taken into account by the taxpayer under sections 35, 162(l), 213, 220, or 223 for the taxable year shall be reduced by the credit allowed by this section to the taxpayer for such year. For purposes of section 38, in the case of a small employer, the health insurance credit determined under this section for the taxable year is an amount equal to 35 percent of the expenses paid by the taxpayer during the taxable year for health insurance coverage for such year provided under a new health plan for employees of such employer. The term `small employer' has the meaning given to such term by section 4980D(d)(2); except that (A) only qualified employees shall be taken into account, and (B) such section shall be applied by substituting `100 employees' for `50 employees'. The amendments made by this section shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2007.
