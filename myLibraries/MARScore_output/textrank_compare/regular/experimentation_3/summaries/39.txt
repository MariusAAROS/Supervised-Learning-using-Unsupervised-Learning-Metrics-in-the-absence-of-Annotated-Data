(C) Nothing in this paragraph affects the obligation of the Department of Defense to comply with section 9, including the prohibition preventing extinction and taking of endangered species and threatened species. (2) Authority to exclude military lands. The Secretary of Defense shall make the determination required under paragraph (2), and transmit notice of the determination to the Secretary of the Interior, before the end of the 90day period beginning on the date on which the Secretary of Defense receives the written notice required under paragraph (1) of a study that covers military lands. Upon receipt of written notification under paragraph (1), the Secretary of Defense shall evaluate the existing environmental protections for the military lands described in the notice and the importance of the military lands to military readiness and preparedness. The Secretary of Defense may require the Secretary of the Interior to exclude all or a portion of the military lands from the study if the Secretary of Defense determines that the environmental protections for the military lands are sufficient and that inclusion of the military lands in the National Park System could adversely impact military readiness and preparedness.
