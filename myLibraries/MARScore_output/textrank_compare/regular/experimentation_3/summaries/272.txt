The technical assistance described in paragraph (1) may include (A) coordination in the selection, location, and timing of alternative fuel recharging and refueling equipment and distribution infrastructure, including the identification of transportation corridors and specific alternative fuels that would be made available; (B) development of protocols and communication standards that facilitate vehicle refueling and recharging into electric, natural gas, and other alternative fuel distribution systems; (C) development of codes and standards for the installation of alternative fuel distribution and recharging and refueling equipment; (D) education and outreach for the deployment of alternative fuel and alternative fueled vehicles; and (E) utility rate design and integration of alternative fueled vehicles into electric and natural gas utility distribution systems. Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall, by rule, develop a methodology for calculating the equivalent volumes of conventional fuel displaced by use of each alternative fuel to assess the effectiveness of alternative fuel and alternative fueled vehicles in reducing oil imports. Not later than 3 years after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall (1) conduct a national assessment (using the methodology developed under subsection (a)) of the effectiveness of alternative fuel and alternative fueled vehicles in reducing oil imports into the United States, including as assessment of (A) market penetration of alternative fuel and alternative fueled vehicles in the United States; (B) successes and barriers to deployment identified by the programs established under this Act; and (C) the maximum feasible deployment of alternative fuel and alternative fueled vehicles by 2020 and 2030; and (2) report to Congress the results of the assessment. In carrying out this title, the Secretary shall provide, at the request of the Governor, mayor, county executive, public utility commissioner, or other appropriate official or designee, technical assistance to State, local, and tribal governments or to a publicprivate partnership described in paragraph (2) to assist with the deployment of alternative fuel and alternative fueled vehicles and infrastructure. Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary (in consultation with the Administrator of General Services, the Secretary of Defense, the Postmaster General, and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget) shall complete an assessment of Federal Government fleets (including the United States Postal Service and the Department of Defense) and submit to Congress a report that describes (1) for each Federal agency with a fleet of more than 200 vehicles, which types of vehicles the agency uses that would or would not be suitable for alternative fuel use either through the procurement of new alternative fueled vehicles, or the conversion to alternative fuel, taking into account the types of vehicles for which alternative fuel could provide comparable functionality and lifecycle costs; (2) the quantity of alternative fueled vehicles that could be deployed by the Federal Government in 5 years and in 10 years, assuming that the vehicles are available and are purchased when new vehicles are needed or existing vehicles are replaced; and (3) the estimated cost and benefits to the Federal Government for vehicle purchases or conversions described in this subsection. The Secretary shall identify barriers and remedies in existing electric and natural gas and oil pipeline transmission and distribution systems to the distribution of alternative fuels and the deployment of alternative fuel recharging and refueling capability, at economically competitive costs of alternative fuel for consumers, including (1) model regulatory rate design and billing for recharging and refueling alternative fueled vehicles; (2) electric grid load management and applications that will allow batteries in plugin electric drive vehicles to be used for grid storage, ancillary services provision, and backup power; (3) integration of plugin electric drive vehicles with smart grid technology, including protocols and standards, necessary equipment, and information technology systems; (4) technical and economic barriers to transshipment of biofuels by oil pipelines, or distribution of hydrogen; and (5) any other barriers to installing sufficient and appropriate alternative fuel recharging and refueling infrastructure. The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Labor, shall award grants to community colleges, other institutions of higher education, and other qualified training and education institutions for the establishment or expansion of programs to provide training and education for vocational workforce development for (1) the manufacture and maintenance of alternative fueled vehicles; and (2) the manufacture, installation, support, and inspection of alternative fuel recharging, refueling, and distribution infrastructure.
