Amounts in the Fund shall supplement (and not supplant) other Federal funding for natural disasters. A transfer of unobligated amounts with respect to a natural disaster may not be made under this subsection until after the end of the 2year period beginning on the date on which the amounts were originally appropriated for that natural disaster. Subject to subsection (d), amounts in the Fund shall be available to the Secretary, until expended, to provide additional amounts for authorized activities described in subsection (b) in areas affected by a natural disaster. Amounts in the Fund, except for amounts described in subsection (d) that are appropriated to the Fund and obligated in accordance with that subsection, may not be obligated in excess of $1,000,000 for a natural disaster until at least 15 days after the date on which the Secretary notifies the Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate of the determination of the Secretary to obligate additional amounts and the reasons for the determination. The Secretary may transfer to the Fund, and merge with other amounts generally appropriated to the Fund, the available unobligated balance of any amounts described in paragraph (2) if, in advance of the transfer, the Secretary (A) determines that the unobligated amounts are no longer needed to respond to the natural disaster for which the amounts were originally appropriated; and (B) provides a certification of that determination to the Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate. Unless otherwise specifically provided in an appropriations Act, the Secretary may transfer to or within the Fund, and merge with other amounts generally appropriated to the Fund, the available unobligated balance of any amounts that are appropriated for fiscal year 2014 or any subsequent fiscal year for the emergency watershed protection program to respond to a natural disaster or are designated by the Congress as an emergency requirement if, in advance of the transfer, the Secretary (A) determines that the unobligated amounts are no longer needed to respond to the natural disaster for which the amounts were originally appropriated; and (B) provides a certification of that determination to the Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate.
