Section 8 of the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 158) is amended by adding at the end the following: (h) It shall be an unfair labor practice for any labor organization and any employer to enter into any contract or agreement, express or implied, whereby the organization and employer agree to modify the terms of any previous agreement in a manner that would result in a reduction or termination of retiree health insurance benefits provided to an employee or a dependent of an employee under the previous agreement, if such modification of the terms of the previous agreement occurs after the date on which the employee retires. 101. PROHIBITION OF UNFAIR REDUCTIONS TO EMPLOYEE AND RETIREE BENEFITS. No claim for retiree benefits shall be limited by section 502(b)(7). Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General of the United States shall submit to Congress a report on the strategies that corporations use to avoid obligations to pay promised employee and retiree benefits.

(B) If the proposal made under paragraph (1) provides for a modification of any benefit of employees of the debtor other than health insurance benefits, including wages and pension benefits, the proposal shall provide for a modification of such benefit of officers and directors of the debtor that is, at a minimum, in an amount equal to the percentage by which such benefit of employees of the debtor was modified.
