The objectives of the plan shall be (i) to identify sources, quantities, and the extent of contamination of dredged material that requires disposal; (ii) to determine management actions that are to be taken to reduce sediment and contaminant loading of dredged areas; (iii) to thoroughly assess alternative locations, treatment technologies, and beneficial uses for dredged material; (iv) to ensure that dumping is the disposal option of last resort for dredged material and is used only after all other options have been exhausted; (v) to secure (I) alternative methods of disposal of dredged materials, including decontamination technologies; and (II) alternative uses of materials, including upland disposal, containment, beach nourishment, marsh restoration, habitat construction, and other beneficial reuses; and (vi) to confirm the specific roles of Federal, State, and local agencies with respect to various aspects of dredged material management. The term `covered project' means (i) any Federal dredging project (or any project conducted for a Federal agency pursuant to Federal authorization); (ii) a dredging project carried out by a nonFederal entity that results in the production of more than 25,000 cubic yards of dredged material; and (iii) any of 2 or more dredging projects carried out by 1 or more nonFederal entities in a covered body of water, simultaneously or sequentially within a 180day period, that result, in the aggregate, in the production of more than 25,000 cubic yards of dredged material. No waiver under section 103(d) shall be available for the dumping of dredged material in any covered body of water. The plan shall include environmental, economic, and other analysis required to meet the objectives listed in subparagraph (B), including (i) an analysis of strategies to reduce sediment loading of harbors and navigation areas; (ii) an analysis of sources of sediment contamination, including recommendations for management measures to limit or reduce those contamination sources; (iii) an analysis of options for reducing dredging needs through modification of navigation strategies; (iv) an analysis of decontamination technologies, including subsequent alternative uses of decontaminated materials (such as upland disposal, containment, beach nourishment, marsh restoration, and habitat construction); and (v) a program for use of alternative methods of disposal and use of dredged material, including alternatives to dumping or dispersal in a covered body of water. (ii) Dumping of dredged material. No dredged material disposal site in any covered body of water that was designated before the date of enactment of this clause shall be used for dumping of dredged material from a covered project until the plan has been approved by the States of Connecticut and New York under clause (i).
