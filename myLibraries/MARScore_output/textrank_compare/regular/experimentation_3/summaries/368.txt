Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit to the relevant congressional committees a strategy to prevent hostile activities by Iran and disrupt and degrade Hizballah's illicit networks in the Western Hemisphere that (1) identifies Department of State priorities, in coordination with other executive branch agencies, for defining United States policy to protect United States interests from Iranian and Hizballah threats in the Western Hemisphere; (2) involves a wholeofgovernment approach led by the Secretary of State, in coordination with other executive branch agencies, to ensure that informationsharing, interdictions, arrests, investigations, indictments, sanctions, and designations related to Hizballah individuals or networks in the Western Hemisphere are integrated, coordinated, and publicly communicated by the United States in a manner that supports United States interests; (3) outlines a counternetwork disruption campaign that includes the input of other executive branch agencies and that uses all appropriate United States national tools; (4) describes Iranian and Hizballah activities in the Western Hemisphere, their relationships with transnational criminal organizations in the region, their use of the region's commodities trade to engage in illicit activities, and their use of Latin American and Caribbean visas, including through Citizenship by Investment Programs to seek admittance into the United States, as well as a plan to address any security vulnerabilities to the United States; (5) includes a review of all relevant United States sanctions that relate to Hizballah's activities in Latin America and the Caribbean and an assessment of their use, effectiveness, and any capability gaps; (6) includes a review of the use of the Department of State's rewards program under section 36 of the State Department Basic Authorities Act (22 U.S.C. 2708) to obtain information related to Latin Americabased Hizballah operatives and illicit networks and an assessment of the effectiveness of this program for targeting Hizballah in the Western Hemisphere; (7) includes a review of all relevant United States sanctions on financial institutions in Latin America and the Caribbean that engage in activities outlined by section 102 of Hizballah International Financing Prevention Act of 2015 (Public Law 114102; 50 U.S.C. 1701 note) and an assessment of the use of the authorities outlined, their effectiveness, and recommendations for improvement; (8) describes Hizballah criminal support networks, including country facilitation, in the Western Hemisphere and outlines a United States approach to partners in the region to address those illicit networks and build country capacity to combat the transnational criminal activities of Hizballah; and (9) includes a review of the actions of governments in the Western Hemisphere to identify, investigate, and prosecute Latin Americabased Hizballah operatives, and enforce sanctions either personally or to their business interests of Latin Americabased Hizballah operatives as well as recommendations for United States action towards governments who refuse to impose sanctions or who willingly facilitate Latin America based Hizballah illicit activities. Such diplomatic engagement may include (1) efforts to target and expose illicit networks, arrest perpetrators, freeze assets, and attack Iran and Hizballah's use of illicit networks using international trade and banking systems; (2) efforts to revoke or deny visas from those implicated in Hizballah activity in the region, including lawyers, accountants, business partners, and service providers and politicians who knowingly facilitate or fail to take measures to counter Hizballah's illicit finance in their own jurisdictions; (3) efforts to assist willing nations with the development of counterorganized crime legislation, the strengthening of financial investigative capacity, and a fullyvetted counter organized crime judicial model in places plagued with corruption; and (4) efforts to persuade governments in the region to list Hizballah as a terrorist organization. This Act may be cited as the Iran and Hizballah Western Hemisphere Prevention Act of 2017. However, multiple reports show that despite United States measures, some of these individuals who are Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGTs) under Executive Order 13224 of September 2001 continue to have access to the global financial system. Congress declares that it is the policy of the United States to continue the policy outlined in the Hizballah International Financing Prevention Act of 2015 (Public Law 114102) and the governmentwide strategy outlined in Countering Iran in the Western Hemisphere Act of 2012 (Public Law 112220) to prevent further penetration of Iran and Hizballah into the Western Hemisphere and prioritize United States diplomatic efforts to engage countries in the Western Hemisphere to disrupt and degrade Hizballah's illicit networks operating in the region. The term hostile activities means any activities that promote antiAmerican or undemocratic views that threaten United States national security through governmenttogovernment, private sector, nongovernmental organizations, or public diplomacy engagement. Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the President shall instruct the Secretary of State to prioritize United States diplomatic engagement with countries in the Western Hemisphere to increase cooperation and build governments' capacity to prevent hostile activities by Iran and disrupt and degrade Hizballah's illicit networks operating in the region.
