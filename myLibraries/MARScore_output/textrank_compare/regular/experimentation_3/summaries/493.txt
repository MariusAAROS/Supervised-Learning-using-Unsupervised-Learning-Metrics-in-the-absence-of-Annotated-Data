With respect to a credit obligation that is payable in at least 3 fully amortizing installments over at least 90 days, the term `fee and interest rate' does not include (i) application or participation fees that in total do not exceed the greater of $30 or, if there is a limit to the credit line, 5 percent of the credit limit, up to $120, if (I) such fees are excludable from the finance charge pursuant to section 106 and regulations issued thereunder; (II) such fees cover all credit extended or renewed by the creditor for 12 months; and (III) the minimum amount of credit extended or available on a credit line is equal to $300 or more; (ii) a late fee charged as authorized by State law and by the agreement that does not exceed either $20 per late payment or $20 per month; or (iii) a creditorimposed not sufficient funds fee charged when a borrower tenders payment on a debt with a check drawn on insufficient funds that does not exceed $15. For purposes of this section, the fee and interest rate includes all charges payable, directly or indirectly, incident to, ancillary to, or as a condition of the extension of credit, including (A) any payment compensating a creditor or prospective creditor for (i) an extension of credit or making available a line of credit, such as fees connected with credit extension or availability such as numerical periodic rates, annual fees, cash advance fees, and membership fees; or (ii) any fees for default or breach by a borrower of a condition upon which credit was extended, such as late fees, creditorimposed not sufficient funds fees charged when a borrower tenders payment on a debt with a check drawn on insufficient funds, overdraft fees, and over limit fees; (B) all fees which constitute a finance charge, as defined by rules of the Board in accordance with this title; (C) credit insurance premiums, whether optional or required; and (D) all charges and costs for ancillary products sold in connection with or incidental to the credit transaction. Congress finds that (1) attempts have been made to prohibit usurious interest rates in America since colonial times; (2) at the State level, 15 states and the District of Columbia have enacted broadly applicable usury laws that protect borrowers from highcost payday loans and many other forms of credit, while 34 states and the District of Columbia have limited annual interest rates to 36 percent or less for 1 or more types of consumer credit; (3) at the Federal level, in 2006, Congress enacted a Federal 36 percent annualized usury cap for service members and their families for covered credit products, as defined by the Department of Defense, which curbed payday, car title, and tax refund lending around military bases; (4) notwithstanding such attempts to curb predatory lending, highcost lending persists in all 50 States due to loopholes in State laws, safe harbor laws for specific forms of credit, and the exportation of unregulated interest rates permitted by preemption; (5) due to the lack of a comprehensive Federal usury cap, consumers annually pay approximately $17,500,000,000 for high cost overdraft loans, as much as $8,600,000,000 for storefront and online payday loans, and nearly $900,000,000 for tax refund anticipation loans; (6) cashstrapped consumers pay on average 400 percent annual interest for payday loans, 300 percent annual interest for car title loans, up to 3,500 percent for bank overdraft loans, 50 to 500 percent annual interest for loans secured by expected tax refunds, and higher than 50 percent annual percentage interest for credit cards that charge junk fees; (7) a national maximum interest rate that includes all forms of fees and closes all loopholes is necessary to eliminate such predatory lending; and (8) alternatives to predatory lending that encourage small dollar loans with minimal or no fees, installment payment schedules, and affordable repayment periods should be encouraged. 4.
