In the event of the death of a borrower of a private educational loan, or if the borrower of a private educational loan is totally and permanently disabled, neither the estate of the borrower nor any cosigner of such private educational loan shall be obligated to repay the outstanding principal or interest on the loan. Section 128(e) of the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1638(e)) is amended by adding at the end the following: (12) Discharge of private educational loans in the event of the death of the borrower. 2. DISCHARGE OF PRIVATE STUDENT LOANS. The Bureau (i) shall develop such safeguards as may be necessary and appropriate to prevent fraud and abuse in the discharge of liability under this subsection; and (ii) notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, may promulgate regulations to reinstate the obligation of loans discharged under this subsection in any case in which the Director determines necessary to protect the public interest. SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the Andrew Prior Act or Andrew's Law.
