Unfortunately, many communities that rely on volunteer firefighters and emergency medical services personnel, especially rural and lowincome communities, do not have the resources to provide such incentives. (6) There is an important role for the Federal Government and the Administrator of the United States Fire Administration in supporting volunteer firefighters and emergency medical services personnel, including providing funds to contribute to incentives for the recruitment and retention of volunteers. A State or local government, nonprofit firefighter association, or governmental or nongovernmental emergency medical service organization that receives funds under this section to carry out a volunteer firefighter incentive program for a fiscal year shall submit to the Secretary a report on (A) the use of such funds; and (B) the programs to recruit or retain volunteer firefighters carried out by the government, association, or organization during that fiscal year. Not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of the Volunteer Firefighter and EMS Support Act of 2008, and annually thereafter, the Secretary shall submit to Congress a report on (A) the activities carried out under this section during the previous year; and (B) the status of programs to recruit and retain volunteer firefighters in the United States. (4) Many volunteer fire stations and emergency medical services organizations in the United States face growing challenges as volunteers contend with increased competition for their time from their jobs, families, and other responsibilities. The term `volunteer firefighter' means an individual who provides firefighting service or emergency medical service to a State or local government or a governmental or nongovernmental organization without pay. A volunteer firefighter may receive benefits or incentives for firefighting service or emergency medical service, including benefits and incentives described in subparagraphs (A) through (G) of paragraph (1).
