The Commissioner shall make the redetermination for the individual only after making redeterminations for individuals for whom eligibility has not lapsed pursuant to subclause (I). The final rule issued pursuant to the preceding sentence applies to individuals without regard to whether the individuals were receiving benefits under this title prior to the effective date of such rule. If the individual submits the application not later than 180 days prior to such date and the Commissioner does not make the redetermination before such date, the Commissioner shall continue to provide the benefit pending the redetermination and shall publish in the Federal Register a notice that the Commissioner was unable to make the redetermination by such date. In the case of an individual who has attained 18 years of age and for whom a determination has been made of eligibility for a benefit under this title by reason of disability, the following applies: (I) Subject to the provisions of this clause, the determination of eligibility is effective for the 3year period beginning on the date of the determination, and the eligibility of the individual lapses unless a determination of continuing eligibility is made before the end of such period, and before the end of each subsequent 3year period. The final rule for the regulations required in subsection (a) shall be issued before the expiration of the 9month period beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act, and shall take effect upon the expiration of such period. Section 1614(a)(3)(A) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1382c(a)(3)(A)) is amended (1) by inserting (i) after (3)(A); and (2) by adding at the end the following clause: (ii) In making determinations under clause (i) regarding the severity of mental impairments, the Secretary shall revise the regulations under subpart P of part 404 of title 20, Code of Federal Regulations in order to accomplish the result that (relative to such regulations as in effect prior to the date on which this clause takes effect) the growth in the enrollment of the program under this title on the basis of mental impairments is slowed.
