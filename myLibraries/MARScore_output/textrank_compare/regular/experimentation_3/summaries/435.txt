Congress finds that (1) cancer is a progressive, degenerative, and often painful disease that afflicts one out of every four persons in the United States and is the second leading cause of death; (2) in the progression of terminal cancer, a significant number of patients experience levels of intense and intractable pain that cannot be effectively treated by presently available medication; (3) the effect of such pain often leads to a severe deterioration in the quality of life of the patient and heartbreak for the family of the patient; (4) the therapeutic use of parenteral diacetylmorphine is not permitted in the United States but extensive clinical research has demonstrated that the drug is a potent, highly soluble painkilling drug when properly formulated and administered under the supervision of a physician; (5) it is in the public interest to make parenteral diacetylmorphine available to patients through controlled channels as a drug for the relief of intractable pain due to terminal cancer; (6) diacetylmorphine is successfully used in Great Britain and other countries for relief of pain due to cancer; (7) the availability of parenteral diacetylmorphine for the limited purposes of controlling intractable pain due to terminal cancer will not adversely affect the abuse of illicit drugs or increase the incidence of pharmacy thefts; (8) the availability of parenteral diacetylmorphine will enhance the ability of physicians to effectively treat and control intractable pain due to terminal cancer; and (9) it is appropriate for the Federal Government to establish a temporary program to permit the use of pharmaceutical dosage forms of parenteral diacetylmorphine for the control of intractable pain due to terminal cancer. Regulations established under this section shall provide that manufacturers of parenteral diacetylmorphine for dispensing under the program shall use adequate methods of, and adequate facilities and controls for, the manufacturing, processing, and packing of such drug to preserve the identity, strength, quality, and purity of the drug. Not later than three months after the date of the enactment of this part, the Secretary shall issue regulations establishing a program (referred to in this section as the `program') under which parenteral diacetylmorphine may be dispensed from pharmacies for the relief of intractable pain due to terminal cancer. Regulations established under this section shall (1) require that parenteral diacetylmorphine be dispensed only to an individual in accordance with the written prescription of a physician; (2) provide that a physician registered under section 302 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 822) may prescribe parenteral diacetylmorphine for individuals for the relief of intractable pain due to terminal cancer; (3) provide that any such prescription shall be in writing; and (4) specify such other criteria for the prescription as the Secretary may determine to be appropriate. Regulations established under this section shall require that parenteral diacetylmorphine be made available only to pharmacies that (A) are hospital pharmacies or such other pharmacies as the regulations specify; (B) are registered under section 302 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 822); (C) meet such qualifications as the regulations specify; and (D) submit an application in accordance with paragraph (2). An application for parenteral diacetylmorphine shall (A) be in such form and submitted in such manner as the Secretary may prescribe; and (B) contain assurances satisfactory to the Secretary that (i) the applicant will comply with such special requirements as the Secretary may prescribe respecting the storage and dispensing of parenteral diacetylmorphine; and (ii) parenteral diacetylmorphine provided under the application will be dispensed through the applicant upon the written prescription of a physician registered under section 302 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 822) to dispense controlled substances in schedule II of such Act (21 U.S.C. 812(2)). It is the intent of Congress that (A) the Secretary shall primarily utilize hospital pharmacies for the dispensing of parenteral diacetylmorphine under the program; and (B) the Secretary may distribute parenteral diacetylmorphine through pharmacies other than hospital pharmacies in cases in which humanitarian concerns necessitate the provision of parenteral diacetylmorphine, a significant need is shown for such provision, and adequate protection is available against the diversion of parenteral diacetylmorphine.
