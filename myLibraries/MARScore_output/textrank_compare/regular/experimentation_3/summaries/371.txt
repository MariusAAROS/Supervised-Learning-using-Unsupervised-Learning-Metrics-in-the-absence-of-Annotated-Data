The purposes of this Act are (1) to conserve, protect, and restore the health of coral reef ecosystems and the species of fish, plants, and animals that depend on those ecosystems; (2) to support the monitoring, assessment, management, and protection of coral reef ecosystems over which the United States has jurisdiction (including coral reef ecosystems located in national wildlife refuges and units of the National Park System); (3) to augment and support the efforts of the Department of the Interior, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and other members of the Coral Reef Task Force; (4) to support research efforts that contribute to coral reef conservation; (5) to support education, outreach, and enforcement for coral reef conservation; (6) to provide financial resources and matching funds for partnership efforts to accomplish the purposes described in paragraphs (1) through (4); and (7) to coordinate with the Coral Reef Task Force and other agencies to address priorities identified by the Coral Reef Task Force. The Secretary shall evaluate and select project proposals for funding based on the degree to which each proposed project (1) is consistent with the purposes of this Act; and (2) would (A) promote the longterm protection, conservation, restoration, or enhancement of coral reef ecosystems in or adjoining areas under the jurisdiction of the Department of the Interior; (B) promote cooperative conservation projects with local communities, nongovernmental organizations, educational or private institutions, affected local governments, territories, or insular areas; (C) enhance public knowledge and awareness of coral reef resources and sustainable use through education and outreach; (D) develop sound scientific information on the condition of and threats to coral reef ecosystems through mapping, monitoring, research and analysis; and (E) increase compliance with laws relating to coral reefs. The Secretary shall provide grants for coral reef conservation projects in accordance with this section. The Secretary shall award grants under this section so that (1) not less than 40 percent of the grant funds available are awarded for coral reef conservation projects in the Pacific Ocean; (2) not less than 40 percent of the grant funds available are awarded for coral reef conservation projects in the Atlantic Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Caribbean Sea; and (3) the remaining grant funds are awarded for coral reef conservation projects that address emergency priorities or threats identified by the Secretary, in consultation with the Coral Reef Task Force. Congress finds that (1) coral reefs have great commercial, recreational, cultural, environmental, and aesthetic value; (2) coral reefs (A) provide habitat to \1/3\ of all marine fish species; (B) are essential building blocks for biodiversity; (C) are instrumental in forming tropical islands; (D) protect coasts from waves and storms; (E) contain an array of potential pharmaceuticals; and (F) support tourism and fishing industries in the United States worth billions of dollars; (3) studies indicate that coral reefs in the United States and around the world are being degraded and severely threatened by human and environmental impacts, including landbased pollution, overfishing, destructive fishing practices, vessel groundings, and climate change; (4) the Department of the Interior (A) manages extensive acreage that contains sensitive coral reef habitat and adjacent submerged land at 20 national wildlife refuges and 9 units of the National Park System (i) in the States of Hawaii and Florida; and (ii) in the territories of Guam, American Samoa, and the United States Virgin Islands; and (B) maintains oversight responsibility for additional significant coral reef resources under Federal jurisdiction in insular areas, territories, and surrounding territorial waters in the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea; (5) few of the 4,200,000 acres of coral reefs of the United States have been mapped or have had their conditions assessed or characterized; (6) the Department of the Interior conducts scientific research and monitoring to determine the structure, function, status, and condition of the coral reefs of the United States; and (7) the Department of the Interior, in cooperation with public and private partners, provides technical assistance and engages in management and conservation activities for coral reef habitats. The term coral reef conservation project means an activity that contributes to or results in preserving, sustaining, or enhancing any coral reef ecosystem as a healthy, diverse, and viable ecosystem, including (A) any action to enhance or improve resource management of a coral reef, such as assessment, scientific research, protection, restoration and mapping; (B) habitat monitoring and any species survey or monitoring of a species; (C) any activity necessary for planning and development of a strategy for coral reef management; (D) community outreach and education on the importance and conservation of coral reefs; and (E) any activity in support of the enforcement of laws relating to coral reefs.
