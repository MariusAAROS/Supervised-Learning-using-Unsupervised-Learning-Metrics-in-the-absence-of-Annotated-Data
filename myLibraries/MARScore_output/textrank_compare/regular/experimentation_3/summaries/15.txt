After deduction of costs attributable to collection, money collected from penalties shall be (1) deposited into the trust fund established pursuant to the Act entitled An Act to provide that the United States shall aid the States in wildliferestoration projects, and for other purposes, approved September 2, 1937 (16 U.S.C. 669) (commonly known as the PitmanRobertson Wildlife Restoration Act), to support the activities authorized by such Act and undertaken by State wildlife management agencies; or (2) used in such other manner as the Secretary determines will enhance the funding and implementation of (A) the North American Waterfowl Management Plan signed by the Secretary of the Interior and the Minister of Environment for Canada in May 1986; or (B) a similar program that the Secretary determines will enhance wildlife management (i) on Federal lands; or (ii) on private or Stateowned lands when the efforts will also provide a benefit to wildlife management objectives on Federal lands. Congress finds that (1) recreational hunting, when carried out pursuant to law (as implemented by the regulations of Federal and State wildlife management agencies) is a necessary and beneficial element in the proper conservation and management of healthy, abundant, and biologically diverse wildlife resources; (2) recreational hunters (because of a generally demonstrated concern with the conservation of wildlife resources and preservation of habitat necessary for the breeding and maintenance of healthy wildlife populations, and through a familiarity with the resources gained from experience in the field) are a valuable asset in ensuring enlightened public input into decisions regarding management and maintenance programs for wildlife resources and habitat; (3)(A) recreational hunting supports industries highly significant to the national economy through sales in interstate commerce of sporting goods; and (B) the Federal excise taxes imposed on the sales provide a major source of funding for vital programs of wildlife conservation and management; (4) various persons are engaging in (and have announced an intent to continue to engage in) a variety of disruptive activities with the premeditated purpose of preventing and interfering with the conduct of lawful recreational hunting on Federal lands, which activities (A) place both recreational hunters and the disruptive persons in imminent jeopardy of grave physical injury or death; (B) disrupt the peaceful, lawful, and prudent conduct of wildlife population and habitat management programs by Federal and State wildlife management agencies; and (C) ultimately may alter the planned program objectives, resulting in (i) undesirable patterns of activity within populations of wildlife; (ii) the endangerment of the future viability of wildlife species; and (iii) damage to habitat values; (5) Federal lands comprise important wildlife habitat resources that (A) support many large, diverse, and vital populations of wildlife; and (B) offer significant opportunities for legal recreational hunting as an important management tool to ensure the future viability of the wildlife populations; (6) it is the right of citizens of the United States freely to enjoy lawful recreational hunting on Federal lands in accordance with regulations promulgated by Federal and State wildlife management agencies; and (7) in many instances under current law, vagueness and ambiguity exist regarding the application of State laws and enforcement activities relating to (A) the safety of hunters; and (B) the legal rights of recreational hunters to participate peacefully in lawful hunts on Federal lands. The term Federal lands means (A) national forests; (B) public lands; (C) national parks; and (D) wildlife refuges. The term lawful hunt means an occasion when an individual is engaged in the taking or harvesting (or attempted taking or harvesting) through a legal means and during a specified legal season of a wildlife or fish, on Federal lands, which activity (A)(i) is authorized by or licensed under the law of the State in which it takes place; or (ii) is regulated by game or fishing seasons established by the State in which it takes place; (B) is not prohibited by a law of the United States; and (C) does not infringe upon a right of an owner of private property. It is unlawful for a person knowingly and with the intent of obstructing, impeding, or interfering with a lawful hunt by an individual to (1) obstruct, impede, or otherwise interfere with a lawful hunt by an individual; (2) scare, herd, harass, decoy, or otherwise engage in activities designed to affect wildlife on Federal lands; (3) engage in activities that prevent or impede the reasonable and usual means of access by those individuals who intend to participate in a lawful hunt, whether the activities occur on Federal lands or upon a public or private road, highway, path, trail, or other normal route of access to Federal lands; (4) take or abuse property, equipment, or hunting dogs being used in conjunction with a lawful hunt; or (5) enter onto Federal lands, travel in interstate commerce, use the United States mails or an instrumentality of interstate telephonic or electronic communications, or transport or cause to be transported in interstate commerce a material or item, to further (A) a scheme or effort to obstruct, impede, or otherwise interfere with a lawful hunt; or (B) the efforts of another person to obstruct, impede, or interfere with a lawful hunt.
