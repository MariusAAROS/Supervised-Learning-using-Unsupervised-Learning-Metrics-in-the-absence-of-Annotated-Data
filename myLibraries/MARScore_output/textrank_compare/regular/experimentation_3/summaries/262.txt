The purposes of this Act are as follows: (1) To establish and strengthen postsecondary education programs emphasizing the nature, history and philosophy of free institutions, the nature of Western civilization, and the nature of the threats to freedom from totalitarianism in all its forms. (2) To develop innovative teacher education programs designed to equip teachers to more effectively impart a knowledge of the nature of free institutions, the threats to free institutions, and the content of Western civilization to elementary, middle and high school teachers. The term western civilization means a field of study in an institution of higher education that (A) encompasses part or all of the period of European history between 500 B.C. and the present day; (B) encompasses part or all of the period of American history between 1607 and the present day; (C) focuses on major events, issues, and historical personages of the period described in subparagraphs (A) and (B); and (D) examines the historical antecedents of the major events, issues, and historical personages described in subparagraph (C); or (E) examines the development of free institutions characteristic of Western civilization, as such term is defined in this Act; (F) examines the intellectual, cultural, political and religious underpinnings of Western civilization, such as the scientific enterprise, entrepreneurship, political pluralism, egalitarianism, moral universalism, and the belief in the possibility of progress; (G) examines the characteristic negative features of Western civilization, such as totalitarianism and social Darwinism; (H) examines the interaction of the West with other civilizations, the Western debt to other civilizations, and the comparative study of high civilization; or (I) conforms with other criteria that the Secretary may prescribe. (7) Development of teacher education programs that (A) stress content mastery in history or government; and (B) stress civic education preparation, including the history and philosophy of free institutions, and the study of Western civilization). The term defense of freedom means fields of study in an institution of higher education that (A) examines potent political threats to free institutions (as such term is defined in this Act), including communism, fascism, national socialism, and nihilism; or (B) examines human tendencies that threaten free institutions, including tribalism, racism, caste consciousness, and zealotry; or (C) examines world history in the period 1901 through 2001, with particular emphasis on the years 1914 to the present, in order to understand the challenges of maintaining a free society while resisting totalitarian movements of global ambition. (3) American citizens who lack knowledge of the organizing principles of Western civilization will also lack a true understanding and appreciation of the democratic principles that define and sustain America as a free people, such as liberty, justice, tolerance, government by the consent of the governed, and equality under the law. (5) Most of the Nation's colleges and universities no longer require United States history or systematic study of Western civilization as a prerequisite to graduation.
