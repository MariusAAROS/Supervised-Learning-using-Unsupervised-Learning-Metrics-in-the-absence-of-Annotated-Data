In any action, the liability of each manufacturer or product seller of the product involved in such action shall be several only and shall not be joint for noneconomic damages. Such manufacturer or product seller shall be liable only for the amount of noneconomic damages allocated to such manufacturer or seller in direct proportion to such manufacturer's or such seller's percentage of responsibility as determined by the trier of fact. Punitive damages may, to the extent permitted by applicable State law, be awarded against a manufacturer or product seller in a civil action if the claimant establishes by clear and convincing evidence that the harm suffered was the result of conduct manifesting actual malice. This Act preempts State law, with respect to both procedural and substantive measures, to the extent that such law (1) permits the recovery of a greater amount of punitive damages by a plaintiff than that authorized by section 2(a)(3); or (2) permits an action for joint liability for noneconomic damages against a manufacturer or product seller of a product involved in the action, which action is prohibited by section 2(b). The term product (A) means any object, substance, mixture, or raw material in a gaseous, liquid, or solid state (i) which is capable of delivery itself, in a mixed or combined state, or as a component part or ingredient, (ii) which is produced for introduction into trade or commerce, (iii) which has intrinsic economic value, and (iv) which is intended for sale or lease to persons for commercial or personal use, and (B) does not include (i) human tissue, human organs, human blood, and human blood products, or (ii) electricity, water delivered by a utility, natural gas, or steam, (5) Product seller.
