For purposes of this subparagraph, the average high cost multiple represents the number of years a State could pay unemployment compensation (based on the reserve ratio of such State) if the State paid such compensation at a rate equivalent to the average benefit cost rate such State paid in the three calendar years during the preceding 20 calendar years (or, if longer, during the period consisting of the preceding three recessions as determined by the National Bureau of Economic Research) that the benefit cost rates were the highest. Subsection (d) of section 203 of such Act is amended to read as follows: State `On' and `Off' Indicators (d) For purposes of this section (1) There is a State `on' indicator for a week if (A)(i) the average rate of total unemployment in such State (seasonally adjusted) for the period consisting of the most recent three months for which data for all States are published before the close of the week equals or exceeds 7.5 percent, and (ii) the average rate of total unemployment in such State (seasonally adjusted) for the 3month period referred to in clause (i) equals or exceeds 110 percent of such average for either (or both) of the corresponding 3month periods ending in the two preceding calendar years; or (B) the average rate of total unemployment for such State (seasonally adjusted) for the period consisting of the most recent 3 months for which data for all States are published before the close of the week equals or exceeds 10 percent. (ii) For December 31, 2001, acceptable progress towards achieving the solvency target shall mean that a State has reduced any difference between 1.0 and the average high cost multiple of such State (if such multiple is less than 1.0) that the Secretary found to exist as of December 31, 1998, by an amount equal to or exceeding 5 percent of such difference. (2) Pursuant to the enactment of appropriate provisions of the State law, the provisions of section 2 may, with respect to such State, take effect for weeks which begin earlier than the weeks specified in paragraph (1), but not earlier than 60 days after the date of enactment of this Act. Section 903(b) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1103(b)) is amended by adding at the end the following new paragraph: (3)(A) If the Secretary of Labor finds that, as of December 31, 2001, a State has not achieved, or made acceptable progress toward achieving, the solvency target established pursuant to subparagraph (B), then, subject to the limitation described in subparagraph (C), the amount available under this section for transfer to such State account for the succeeding fiscal year shall, in lieu of being so transferred, be transferred to the States meeting the requirements of this subsection. For purposes of subsection (f)(2), the rate of insured unemployment for any thirteenweek period shall be determined by reference to the average monthly covered employment under the State law for the first four of the most recent six calendar quarters ending before the close of such period.
