The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall enter into an arrangement with the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies to conduct a study on the following: (1) The ramifications of Medicare reimbursement reductions for DXA and VFA on beneficiary access to bone mass measurement benefits in general and in rural and minority communities specifically. Congress finds the following: (1) Since 1997, Congress has recognized the importance of osteoporosis prevention by standardizing reimbursement under the Medicare program for bone mass measurement. (2) One decade later, osteoporosis remains underdiagnosed and untreated despite numerous Federal initiatives, including recommendations of the United States Preventive Services Task Force, the 2004 United States Surgeon General's Report on Bone Health and Osteoporosis, and inclusion of bone mass measurement in the Welcome to Medicare exam. (9) Underutilization of bone mass measurement will strain the Medicare budget because (A) 55 percent of the people age 50 and older in 2002 had osteoporosis or low bone mass; (B) more than 61,000,000 people in the United States are projected to have osteoporosis or low bone mass in 2020, as compared to 43,000,000 in 2002; (C) osteoporosis fractures are projected to increase by almost 50 percent over the next 2 decades with at least 3,000,000 fractures expected to occur annually by 2025; (D) the population aged 65 and older represents 89 percent of fracture costs; and (E) the economic burden of osteoporosis fractures are projected to increase by 50 percent over the next 2 decades, reaching $25,300,000,000 in 2025. (10) Underutilization of bone mass measurement will also strain the Medicaid budget, which funds treatment for osteoporosis in lowincome Americans. Since twothirds of all DXA scans are performed in nonfacility settings, such as physician offices, patient access to bone mass measurement will be severely compromised when physicians discontinue providing those tests in their offices, thereby exacerbating the current underutilization of the benefit. The amendment made by subsection (a) shall apply to bone mass measurement furnished on or after January 1, 2008.
