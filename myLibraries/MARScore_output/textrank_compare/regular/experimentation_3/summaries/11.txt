The material terms of performancebased remuneration paid to covered employees specify that (I) not less than 50 percent of such remuneration must vest no earlier than 5 years after the date of payment, (II) the proportion of such remuneration payable under vesting arrangements must increase based on the level of seniority or responsibility of the employee, (III) such remuneration payable under vesting arrangements must vest on a basis no faster than pro rata over the specified number of years of such arrangement (not to be less than 5), (IV) such remuneration is contingent on a formal agreement between the taxpayer and the employee which forbids the use of personal hedging strategies, remuneration related insurance, or liabilityrelated insurance which undermines the risk alignment effects of this paragraph, (V) in the case of an employer which is a publicly held corporation, not less than 50 percent of such remuneration must be in the form of stock in the employer, and (VI) in the case of remuneration paid to a chief executive officer or chief financial officer (if such chief financial officer is a covered employee) of a publicly held corporation, such remuneration must be subject to substantial forfeiture requirements in the event the taxpayer is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to material noncompliance, as a result of misconduct, with any financial reporting requirement under Federal securities laws. For purposes of this clause, the date on which remuneration is deemed to have vested is the first date on which such remuneration is not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture (within the meaning of section 409A(d)(4)). In the case of a systemically significant financial institution which is not a publicly held corporation, in addition to the requirements of subparagraph (C), paragraph (4)(C) shall be applied by substituting the following for clauses (i) through (iii) thereof: (i) the taxpayer commissions an annual, external review of its compensation policies and practices, including an examination and analysis of the taxpayer's compliance with the requirements of this subsection, and (ii) the taxpayer obtains certification from an unrelated third party commissioned to evaluated compensation practices that performance goals and other material terms under which the remuneration is to be paid are satisfied before any payment of such remuneration is made.'. Each systemically significant financial institution which is a publicly held corporation shall submit to the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and shall make publicly available, an annual report on compensation policies and practices which describes (A) the process used to develop and modify such institution's compensation policies, including the composition and the mandate of such institution's compensation committee, (B) the actions taken by such institution to comply with section 162(m)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, (C) any additional actions taken to implement the Principles for Sound Compensation Practices adopted by the Financial Stability Board established by the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors, (D) the most important design characteristics of such institution's compensation policies, including criteria used for performance measurement and risk adjustment, the linkage between pay and performance, vesting policy and criteria, and the parameters used for allocating cash versus other forms of remuneration, (E) aggregate quantitative information on remuneration paid by such institution, differentiating between remuneration paid to senior executive officers and to employees whose actions have a material impact on the risk exposure of such institution, which indicates the amounts of remuneration for the financial year (divided into fixed and variable remuneration) and the number of employees to which such remuneration was paid, and (F) the amount of remuneration paid by such institution during the financial year preceding the year of the report which was nondeductible by reason of section 162(m) of such Code. The report required under paragraph (1) shall be submitted beginning in calendar year 2011 (or, if later, the calendar year after the year in which an entity first becomes a systemically significant financial institution which is a publicly held corporation), at such time during such year and each subsequent year as the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission shall specify. Paragraph (3) shall be applied (I) by substituting `such employee is among the 25 highest compensated employees' for so much of subparagraph (B) as precedes `for the taxable year (other than the chief executive officer). Any employee whose applicable employee remuneration for the taxable year exceeds $1,000,000 is presumed to engage in actions which have a material impact on the risk exposure of the taxpayer unless the taxpayer submits an information return to the Secretary which describes the role and responsibilities of such employee and the reason such employee should not be considered to have a material impact on the risk exposure of the taxpayer.
