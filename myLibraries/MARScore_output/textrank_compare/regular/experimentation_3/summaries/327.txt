To encourage collaborative management of the Chacoan archaeological objects associated with northwestern New Mexico, the Secretary may enter into cooperative agreements with the University, other units of the National Park System, other Federal agencies, and Indian tribes for (1) the curation of and conduct of research on artifacts in the museum collection described in section 2(4); and (2) the development, use, management, and operation of the portion of the Hibben Center leased to the National Park Service under subsection (c)(1). The term Hibben Center means the Hibben Center for Archaeological Research to be constructed at the University under section 4(a). Congress finds that (1) when the Chaco Culture National Historical Park was established in 1907 as the Chaco Canyon National Monument, the University of New Mexico owned a significant portion of the land located within the boundaries of the Park; (2) during the period from the 1920's to 1947, the University of New Mexico conducted archaeological research in the Chaco Culture National Historical Park; (3) in 1949, the University of New Mexico (A) conveyed to the United States all right, title, and interest of the University in and to the land in the Park; and (B) entered into a memorandum of agreement with the National Park Service establishing a research partnership with the Park; (4) since 1971, the Chaco Culture National Historical Park, through memoranda of understanding and cooperative agreements with the University of New Mexico, has maintained a research museum collection and archive at the University; (5) both the Park and the University have large, significant archaeological research collections stored at the University in multiple, inadequate, inaccessible, and cramped repositories; and (6) insufficient storage at the University makes research on and management, preservation, and conservation of the archaeological research collections difficult. The Secretary may, in cooperation with the University, construct and occupy a portion of the Hibben Center for Archaeological Research at the University. The Secretary may provide to the University a grant to pay the Federal share of the construction and related costs for the Hibben Center under paragraph (2). Before funds made available under section 5 may be expended for construction costs under subsection (b)(1) or for the costs for tenant improvements under paragraph (2), the University shall offer to enter into a longterm lease with the United States that (A) provides to the National Park Service space in the Hibben Center for storage, research, and offices; and (B) is acceptable to the Secretary. The term Park means the Chaco Culture National Historical Park in the State of New Mexico.
