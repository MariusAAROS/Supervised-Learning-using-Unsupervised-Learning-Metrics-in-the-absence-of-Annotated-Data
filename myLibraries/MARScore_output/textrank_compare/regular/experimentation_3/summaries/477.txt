Subsection (c) of section 38 of such Code (relating to limitation based on amount of tax) is amended by adding at the end the following new paragraph: (3) Special rules for stage 3 aircraft modification credit. For purposes of paragraph (3)(A)(iii), a qualified stage 3 aircraft modification property shall be treated as originally placed in service by a person if it is sold to such person or is leased by such person within 3 months of the date such modifications are made. In the case of the stage 3 aircraft modification credit, the credit allowable under subsection (a) for any taxable year shall not exceed the excess (if any) of (i) the sum of (I) the taxpayer's tentative minimum tax liability under section 55(b) for such taxable year determined without regard to the stage 3 aircraft modification credit, plus (II) the taxpayer's regular tax liability for such taxable year (as defined in section 26(b)), over (ii) the sum of the credits allowable against the taxpayer's regular tax liability under part IV (other than section 34 and the stage 3 aircraft modification credit). If the amount of the credit determined under subparagraph (A) exceeds the amount described in clause (ii) of subparagraph (B), then the excess shall be deemed to be the adjusted net minimum tax for such taxable year for purposes of section 53.
