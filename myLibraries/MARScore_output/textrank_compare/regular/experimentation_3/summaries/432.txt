The amendments made by this section shall apply to plan amendments taking effect in plan years beginning on or after the earlier of (A) the later of (i) January 1, 1999, or (ii) the date on which the last of the collective bargaining agreements pursuant to which the plan is maintained terminates (determined without regard to any extension thereof after the date of the enactment of this Act), or (B) January 1, 2001. Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to qualified pension, profitsharing, and stock bonus plans) is amended by inserting after paragraph (34) the following new paragraph: (35) Notice requirements for large defined benefit plans significantly reducing future benefit accruals. For purposes of subclause (II), the term `benefit factors' means social security benefits and all other relevant factors under section 411(b)(1)(A) used to compute benefits under the plan which had increased from the 2d plan year preceding the plan year in which the effective date of the plan amendment occurs to the 1st such preceding plan year. (III) For purposes of subclause (II), the term `benefit factors' means social security benefits and all other relevant factors under section 204(b)(1)(A) used to compute benefits under the plan which had increased from the 2d plan year preceding the plan year in which the effective date of the plan amendment occurs to the 1st such preceding plan year. If a large defined benefit plan adopts an amendment which has the effect of significantly reducing the rate of future benefit accrual of 1 or more participants, a trust which is part of such plan shall not constitute a qualified trust under this section unless, after adoption of such amendment and not less than 15 days before its effective date, the plan administrator provides (i) a written statement of benefit change described in subparagraph (B) to each applicable individual, and (ii) a written notice setting forth the plan amendment and its effective date to each employee organization representing participants in the plan.
