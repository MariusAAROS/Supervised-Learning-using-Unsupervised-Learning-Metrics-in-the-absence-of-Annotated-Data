States, counties, municipalities, and multi jurisdictional transportation authorities that operate or manage roads, highways, bridges, railroads, busses, ferries, or other transportation systems are authorized to establish programs that offer discounted transportation tolls, user fees, or other fares for residents of specific geographic areas in order to reduce or alleviate toll burdens imposed upon such residents. (3) Residents of certain municipalities, counties, and other localities endure significant or disproportionate toll, user fee, or fare burdens compared to others who have a greater number of transportation options because such residents (A) live in geographic areas that are not conveniently located to the access points for roads, highways, bridges, rail, busses, ferries, and other transportation systems; (B) live on islands, peninsulas, or in other places that are only accessible through a means that requires them to pay a toll, user fee, or fare; or (C) are required to pay much more for transportation access than residents of surrounding jurisdictions, or in other jurisdictions across the country, for similar transportation options. (2) Revenue generated from transportation tolls, user fees, and fares is used to support various infrastructure maintenance and capital improvement projects that directly benefit commuters and indirectly benefit the regional and national economy. (4) To address this inequality, and to reduce the financial hardship often imposed on such residents, several State and municipal governments and multiState transportation authorities have established programs that authorize discounted transportation tolls, user fees, and fares for such residents. The purposes of this Act are (1) to clarify the existing authority of States, counties, municipalities, and multijurisdictional transportation authorities to establish programs that offer discounted transportation tolls, user fees, and fares for residents in specific geographic areas; and (2) to authorize the establishment of such programs, as necessary. Congress finds the following: (1) Residents of various localities and political subdivisions throughout the United States are subject to tolls, user fees, and fares to access certain roads, highways, bridges, railroads, busses, ferries, and other transportation systems. States, counties, municipalities, and multi jurisdictional transportation authorities that operate or manage roads, highways, bridges, railroads, busses, ferries, or other transportation systems are authorized to enact such rules or regulations that may be necessary to establish the programs authorized under subsection (a).
