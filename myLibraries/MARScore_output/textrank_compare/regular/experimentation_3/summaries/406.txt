(4) The grant will not be expended to make payment for services authorized under section 201(a) to the extent that payment has been made, or can reasonably be expected to be made, with respect to such services (A) under any State compensation program, under an insurance policy, or under any Federal or State health benefits program; or (B) by an entity that provides health services on a prepaid basis. The Congress finds that (1) lupus is a serious, complex, inflammatory, autoimmune disease of particular concern to women; (2) lupus affects women nine times more often than men; (3) there are three main types of lupus: systemic lupus, a serious form of the disease that affects many parts of the body; discoid lupus, a form of the disease that affects mainly the skin; and druginduced lupus caused by certain medications; (4) lupus can be fatal if not detected and treated early; (5) the disease can simultaneously affect various areas of the body, such as the skin, joints, kidneys, and brain, and can be difficult to diagnose because the symptoms of lupus are similar to those of many other diseases; (6) lupus disproportionately affects AfricanAmerican women, as the prevalence of the disease among such women is three times the prevalence among white women, and an estimated 1 in 250 AfricanAmerican women between the ages of 15 and 65 develops the disease; (7) it has been estimated that between 1,400,000 and 2,000,000 Americans have been diagnosed with the disease, and that many more have undiagnosed cases; (8) current treatments for the disease can be effective, but may lead to damaging side effects; (9) many victims of the disease suffer debilitating pain and fatigue, making it difficult to maintain employment and lead normal lives; and (10) in fiscal year 1996, the amount allocated by the National Institutes of Health for research on lupus was $33,000,000, which is less than onehalf of 1 percent of the budget for such Institutes.
