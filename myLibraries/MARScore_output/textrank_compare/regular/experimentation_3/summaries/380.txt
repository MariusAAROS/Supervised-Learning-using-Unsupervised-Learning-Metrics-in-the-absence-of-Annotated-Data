Congress finds the following: (1) In February 2007, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released data indicating that (A) the occurrence of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) increased between 1996 and 2006 from an estimated 1 in 500 to an estimated 1 in 150; and (B) the behaviors of children who were classified as suffering from ASD were consistent with the DSMIV TR criteria for Autistic Disorder, Asperger's Disorder, and Pervasive Developmental DisorderNot Otherwise Specified. (2) Autism is a complex neurological disorder that affects individuals in the areas of social interaction and communication. Because autism is a spectrum disorder, it affects each individual differently and to varying degrees of severity. (4) The increased number of children diagnosed with autism is a growing and urgent concern for families, healthcare professionals, and educators. (5) The prevalence of autism in developing countries is growing rapidly. (6) Children with autism who receive intensive and appropriate educational services before 5 years of age often make significant functional improvements.
