The President shall impose sanctions pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) with respect to a person if, on or after the date that is 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the person continues to knowingly and directly provide specialized financial messaging services to, or knowingly enable or facilitate direct or indirect access to such messaging services for (1) the Central Bank of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea; (2) a financial institution that facilitates any transaction or transactions or provides significant financial services for nuclear development or proliferation for or on behalf of North Korea; or (3) a person identified on the list of specially designated nationals and blocked persons maintained by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the Department of the Treasury by reason of assisting the nuclear development or proliferation efforts of North Korea. (8) Experts link North Korea to the hacking of specialized financial messaging institutions, resulting in the theft of $81,000,000 from the central bank of Bangledesh. It is the sense of Congress that (1) providers of specialized financial messaging services are a critical link to the international financial system; (2) directly providing specialized financial messaging services to, or enabling or facilitating direct or indirect access to such messaging services for, any financial institution is inconsistent with paragraph 11 of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 2094; and (3) the United States reaffirms its commitment to its allies in the region, including the Republic of Korea and Japan, which are directly threatened by North Korea. For purposes of this section, enabling or facilitating direct or indirect access to specialized financial messaging services for the Central Bank of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, a financial institution described in subsection (a)(2), or a person described in subsection (a)(3) includes doing so by serving as an intermediary financial institution with access to such messaging services. (6) Specialized financial messaging services allow for messaging and contact, including the transfer of funds, between financial institutions. SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
