In the case of an individual, there shall be allowed as a deduction for the taxable year the aggregate amount paid by such individual as premiums under a high deductible health plan with respect to months during such year for which such individual is an eligible individual with respect to such health plan. If 2 or more individuals are covered by a high deductible health plan for any month but only 1 of such individuals is an eligible individual for such month, only 50 percent of the aggregate amount paid by such eligible individual as premiums under the plan with respect to such month shall be taken into account for purposes of this section. In the case of an individual, there shall be allowed as a credit against the tax imposed by this subtitle for the taxable year an amount equal to the product of (1) the sum of the rates of tax in effect under sections 3101(a), 3101(b), 3111(a), and 3111(b) for the calendar year in which the taxable year begins, multiplied by (2) the sum of (A) the aggregate amount paid by such individual as premiums under a high deductible health plan which is allowed as a deduction under section 224 for the taxable year, and (B) the aggregate amount paid to a health savings account of such individual which is allowed as a deduction under section 223 for the taxable year. The credit allowed under subsection (a) with respect to any individual for any taxable year shall not exceed the specified employment taxes with respect to such individual for such taxable year. For purposes of this subsection, the term `specified employment taxes' means, with respect to any individual for any taxable year, the sum of (A) the taxes imposed under sections 3101(a), 3101(b), 3111(a), 3111(b), 3201(a), 3211(a), and 3221(a) (taking into account any adjustments or refunds under section 6413) with respect to wages and compensation received by such individual during the calendar year in which such taxable year begins, and (B) the taxes imposed under subsections (a) and (b) of section 1401 with respect to the selfemployment income of such individual for such taxable year. For purposes of this subsection, the term `employment compensation' means, with respect to any individual for any taxable year, the sum of (A) the wages (as defined in section 3121(a)) and compensation (as defined in section 3231(e)) received by such individual during the calendar year in which such taxable year begins, and (B) the selfemployment income (as defined in section 1402(b)) of such individual for such taxable year.
