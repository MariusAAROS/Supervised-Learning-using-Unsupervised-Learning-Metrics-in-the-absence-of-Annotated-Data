The Congress finds that (1) the amount of the flood insurance claims resulting from Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita will likely exceed the aggregate amount of all claims previously paid in the history of the national flood insurance program, and will require an increase in the program's borrowing authority; (2) flood insurance policyholders have a legitimate expectation that they will receive fair and timely compensation for losses covered under their policies; (3) substantial flooding has occurred, and will likely occur again, outside of the areas designated as the 100year floodplain; (4) to adequately and correctly assess potential flood damage and losses in all areas on the United States, the national flood insurance program will need to update its flood maps with the latest technology; (5) the maximum coverage limits for flood insurance policies should be increased to reflect inflation and the increased cost of housing; (6) significant reforms to the national flood insurance program required in the BunningBereuterBlumenauer Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2004 have yet to be implemented; and (7) despite reforms required in the BunningBereuter Blumenauer Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2004, the national flood insurance program requires a modernized and updated administrative model to ensure that the people of the United States have continued access to flood insurance. As directed in section 205 of the Bunning BereuterBlumenauer Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2004 (42 U.S.C. 4011 note), the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency is again directed to, not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, establish an appeals process through which holders of a flood insurance policy may appeal the decisions, with respect to claims, proofs of loss, and loss estimates relating to such flood insurance policy as required by such section. The purposes of this Act are (1) to protect the integrity of the national flood insurance program by fully funding existing legal obligations expected by existing policyholders who have paid policy premiums in return for flood insurance coverage; (2) to increase incentives for homeowners and communities to participate in the national flood insurance program and to improve oversight to ensure full participation in the program for owners of properties for which such participation is mandatory; (3) to increase awareness of homeowners of flood risks and improve the quality of information regarding such risks provided to homeowners; and (4) to better mitigate future flood damage risks through a combination of enhanced protective measures, property elevation, and buyouts of floodprone properties. The study under this subsection shall assess (A) the regulatory, financial and economic impacts of extending such requirements on the costs of homeownership, the actuarial soundness of the national flood insurance program, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, local communities, insurance companies, and local land use; (B) the effectiveness of extending such requirements in protecting homeowners from financial loss and in protecting the financial soundness of the national flood insurance program, and the effectiveness of extending such requirements in comparison with providing for more effective enforcement of existing mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements; (C) the feasibility of extending such requirements taking into consideration the need for identifying and mapping the 500year floodplain; (D) any liability on the part of lenders to comply with or enforce such extended requirements; (E) any burdens on building officials and flood plain managers to implement such requirements in the expanded area; (F) any increased burden on the Federal Emergency Management Agency to make determinations on exemptions to the floodplain and approval of local decisions; (G) the effects of extending such requirements on existing policy holders of flood insurance coverage for properties located in the 100year floodplain, including the effects on continued compliance and premium rates; and (H) the effects of extending such requirements on the ability of homeowners to make renovations to their homes. Subsection (b) of section 1306 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4013) is amended (1) in paragraph (4), by striking and at the end; (2) in paragraph (5), by striking the period at the end and inserting a semicolon; and (3) by adding at the end the following new paragraphs: (6) in the case of any residential property, each renewal or new contract for flood insurance coverage shall provide not less than $1,000 aggregate liability per dwelling unit for any necessary increases in living expenses incurred by the insured when losses from a flood make the residence unfit to live in, which coverage shall be available only at chargeable rates that are not less than the estimated premium rates for such coverage determined in accordance with section 1307(a)(1); (7) in the case of any residential property, coverage for additional living expenses described in paragraph (6) shall be made available to every insured upon renewal and every applicant in excess of the limits provided in paragraph (6) in such amounts and at such rates as the Director shall establish, except that such chargeable rates shall not be less than the estimated premium rates for such coverage determined in accordance with section 1307(a)(1); and (8) in the case of any commercial property, optional coverage for losses resulting from any partial or total interruption of the insured's business caused by damage to, or loss of, such property from a flood shall be made available to every insured upon renewal and every applicant, except that (A) for purposes of such coverage, losses shall be determined based on the profits the covered business would have earned, based on previous financial records, had the flood not occurred; and (B) such coverage shall be made available only at chargeable rates that are not less than the estimated premium rates for such coverage determined in accordance with section 1307(a)(1). Subsection (c) of section 5 of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974 (12 U.S.C. 2604(c)) is amended by adding at the end the following new sentence: Each such good faith estimate shall include a conspicuous statement that flood insurance coverage for residential real estate is generally available under the National Flood Insurance Program whether or not the real estate is located in an area having special flood hazards and that, to obtain such coverage, a home owner or purchaser should contact a hazard insurance provider. The Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency is directed to enforce the minimum training and education requirements for all insurance agents who sell flood insurance policies that have been established under the notice published September 1, 2005 (70 Fed.
