To be eligible to receive an incentive grant under subsection (b), an entity shall prepare and submit to the Secretary an application at such time, in such manner and containing such information as the Secretary may require, including (A) an assessment of the need within the community to be served for the establishment or expansion of a program to facilitate the discharge of individuals in need of longterm care who are in hospitals or other acute care facilities into home and communitycare programs that provide individually planned, flexible services that reflect individual choice or preference rather than nursing home or institutional settings; (B) a plan for establishing or expanding a program for identifying individuals in hospital or acute care facilities who are in need of individualized longterm care provided in home and communitybased settings rather than nursing homes or other institutional settings and undertaking the planning and management of individualized care plans to facilitate discharge into such settings; (C) assurances that nongovernmental case management agencies funded under grants awarded under this section are not direct providers of home and communitybased services; (D) satisfactory assurances that adequate home and communitybased long term care services are available, or will be made available, within the community to be served so that individuals being discharged from hospitals or acute care facilities under the proposed program can be served in such home and communitybased settings, with flexible, individualized care which reflects individual choice and preference; (E) a description of the manner in which the program to be administered with amounts received under the grant will be continued after the termination of the grant for which such application is submitted; and (F) a description of any waivers or approvals necessary to expand the number of individuals served in federally funded home and communitybased long term care programs in order to provide satisfactory assurances that adequate home and communitybased long term care services are available in the community to be served. Congress finds that (1) demonstration programs and projects have been developed to offer care management to hospitalized individuals awaiting discharge who are in need of longterm health care services that meet individual needs and preferences in home and communitybased settings as an alternative to longterm nursing home care or institutional placement; and (2) there is a need to disseminate information and technical assistance to hospitals and State and local community organizations regarding such programs and projects and to provide incentive grants to State and local public and private agencies, including area agencies on aging, to establish and expand programs that offer care management to individuals awaiting discharge from acute care hospitals who are in need of longterm care so that services to meet individual needs and preferences can be arranged in home and communitybased settings as an alternative to longterm placement in nursing homes or other institutional settings. The Secretary shall establish a program under which incentive grants may be awarded to assist private and public agencies, including area agencies on aging, and organizations in developing and expanding programs and projects that facilitate the discharge of individuals in hospitals or other acute care facilities who are in need of longterm care services and placement of such individuals into home and communitybased settings.
