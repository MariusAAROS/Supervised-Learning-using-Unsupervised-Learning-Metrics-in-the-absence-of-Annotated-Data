In selecting States to conduct demonstration projects under this section, the Secretary shall (A) ensure that the applications selected represent a diversity of minimum benefits distributed throughout the range specified in subsection (d)(1)(B)(i); (B) consider the geographic dispersion and variation in population of the applicants; (C) give priority to States the applications of which demonstrate (i) significant recent improvements in (I) establishing paternity and child support awards, (II) enforcement of child support awards, and (III) collection of child support payments; (ii) a record of effective automation; and (iii) that efforts will be made to link child support systems with other service delivery systems; (D) ensure that the proposed projects will be of a size sufficient to obtain a meaningful measure of the effects of child support assurance; (E) give priority, first, to States intending to operate a child support assurance project on a statewide basis, and, second, to States that are committed to phasing in an expansion of such project to the entire State, if interim evaluations suggest such expansion is warranted; and (F) ensure that, if feasible, the States selected use a variety of approaches for child support guidelines. The Congress finds that (1) the number of singleparent households has increased significantly; (2) there is a high correlation between childhood poverty and growing up in a singleparent household; (3) family dissolution often brings the economic consequence of a lower standard of living for the custodian and children; (4) children are nearly twice as likely to be in poverty after a family dissolution as before a family dissolution; (5) onefourth of the single mothers who are owed child support receive none and another onefourth of such mothers receive only partial child support payments; (6) single mothers above and below the poverty line are equally likely to receive none of the child support they are owed; and (7) the failure of children to receive an adequate level of child support limits the ability of such children to thrive and to develop their potential and leads to longterm societal costs in terms of health care, welfare, and loss in labor force productivity. It is the purpose of this Act to enable participating States to establish child support assurance systems in order to improve the economic circumstances of children who do not receive a minimum level of child support from the noncustodial parents of such children and to strengthen the establishment and enforcement of child support awards. In order to encourage States to provide a guaranteed minimum level of child support for every eligible child not receiving such support, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (hereafter in this section referred to as the Secretary) shall make grants to not more than 6 States to conduct demonstration projects for the purpose of establishing or improving a system of assured minimum child support payments in accordance with this section. A child support assurance project funded under this section shall provide that (A) any child (as defined in paragraph (2)) with a living noncustodial parent for whom a child support order has been sought (as defined in paragraph (3)) or obtained and any child who meets good cause criteria for not seeking or enforcing a support order is eligible for the assured child support benefit; (B) the assured child support benefit shall be paid promptly to the custodial parent at least once a month and shall be (i) an amount determined by the State which is (I) not less than $1,500 per year for the first child, $1,000 per year for the second child, and $500 per year for the third and each subsequent child, and (II) not more than $3,000 per year for the first child and $1,000 per year for the second and each subsequent child; (ii) offset and reduced to the extent that the custodial parent receives child support in a month from the noncustodial parent; (iii) indexed and adjusted for inflation; and (iv) in the case of a family of children with multiple noncustodial parents, calculated in the same manner as if all such children were full siblings, but any child support payment from a particular noncustodial parent shall only be applied against the assured child support benefit for the child or children of that particular noncustodial parent; (C) for purposes of determining the need of a child or relative and the level of assistance, onehalf of the amount received as a child support payment shall be disregarded from income until the total amount of child support and Aid to Families With Dependent Children benefit received under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act equals the Federal poverty level for a family of comparable size; (D) in the event that the family as a whole becomes ineligible for Aid to Families With Dependent Children under part A of the Social Security Act due to consideration of assured child support benefits, the continuing eligibility of the caretaker for Aid to Families With Dependent Children under such title shall be calculated without consideration of the assured child support benefit; and (E) in order to participate in the child support assurance project, the child's caretaker shall apply for services of the State's child support enforcement program under part D of title IV of the Social Security Act. (2) For purposes of this section, the term child means an individual who is of such an age, disability, or educational status as to be eligible for child support as provided for by the law of the State in which such individual resides. For purposes of (1) the United States Housing Act of 1937; (2) title V of the Housing Act of 1949; (3) section 101 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965; (4) sections 221(d)(3), 235, and 236 of the National Housing Act; (5) the Food Stamp Act of 1977; (6) title XIX of the Social Security Act; and (7) child care assistance provided through part A of title IV of the Social Security Act, the Child Care and Development Block Grant, or title XX of the Social Security Act, any payment made to an individual within the demonstration project area for child support up to the amount which an assured child support benefit would provide shall not be treated as income and shall not be taken into account in determining resources for the month of its receipt and the following month.
