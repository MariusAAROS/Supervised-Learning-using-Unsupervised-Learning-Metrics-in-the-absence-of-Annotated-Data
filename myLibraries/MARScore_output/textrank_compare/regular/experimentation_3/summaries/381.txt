In the case of an individual described in section 1902(dd) who is eligible for medical assistance only because of subparagraph (A)(10)(i)(VIII), such medical assistance may be limited to family planning services and supplies described in 1905(a)(4)(C) and, at the State's option, medical diagnosis or treatment services that are provided in conjunction with a family planning service in a family planning setting provided during the period in which such an individual is eligible. The term `presumptive eligibility period' means, with respect to an individual described in subsection (a), the period that (A) begins with the date on which a qualified entity determines, on the basis of preliminary information, that the individual is described in section 1902(dd); and (B) ends with (and includes) the earlier of (i) the day on which a determination is made with respect to the eligibility of such individual for services under the State plan; or (ii) in the case of such an individual who does not file an application by the last day of the month following the month during which the entity makes the determination referred to in subparagraph (A), such last day. The State agency shall provide qualified entities with (A) such forms as are necessary for an application to be made by an individual described in subsection (a) for medical assistance under the State plan; and (B) information on how to assist such individuals in completing and filing such forms. A qualified entity that determines under subsection (b)(1)(A) that an individual described in subsection (a) is presumptively eligible for medical assistance under a State plan shall (A) notify the State agency of the determination within 5 working days after the date on which determination is made; and (B) inform such individual at the time the determination is made that an application for medical assistance is required to be made by not later than the last day of the month following the month during which the determination is made. Section 1902 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396a) is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection: (dd)(1) Individuals described in this subsection are individuals who (A) meet at least the income eligibility standards established under the State plan as of May 1, 2006, for pregnant women or such higher income eligibility standard for such women as the State may establish; and (B) are not pregnant.
