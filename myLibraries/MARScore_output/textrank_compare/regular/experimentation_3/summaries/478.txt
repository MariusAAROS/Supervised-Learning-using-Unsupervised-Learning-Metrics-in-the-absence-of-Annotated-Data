If the aggregate deductions for any taxable year exceed the gross active income for such taxable year, the amount of the deductions specified in subsection (d) for the succeeding taxable year (determined without regard to this subsection) shall be increased by the sum of (1) such excess, plus (2) the product of such excess and the 3month Treasury rate for the last month of such taxable year. There is hereby imposed on the income of every individual a tax equal to 15 percent of the excess of the earned income of such individual for the taxable year over the standard exemption amount for such year. There is hereby imposed on the income of every individual a tax equal to 15 percent of the excess of (1) the earned income of the taxpayer for the taxable year, over (2) the standard exemption amount and the excess qualified residence interest amount for such taxpayer for such year., and (2) in subsection (b), by redesignating paragraph (2) as paragraph (3) and by inserting after paragraph (1) the following new paragraph: (2) Excess qualified residence interest amount. The excess qualified residence amount for any taxable year is equal to the excess (if any) of (A) the amount which would have been allowable as a deduction to the taxpayer for such year under section 163(h)(3), as in effect on the day before the effective date of the Flat Tax Act of 1995 (determined without regard to section 68 (as so in effect)), with respect to any indebtedness incurred on or before such day, over (B) onehalf of the basic standard exemption for an individual for such year. For purposes of subparagraph (A), the additional standard exemption is $5,000 for each dependent (as defined in section 152) (i) whose earned income for the calendar year in which the taxable year of the taxpayer begins is less than the basic standard exemption specified in subparagraph (B)(iii), or (ii) who is a child of the taxpayer and who (I) has not attained the age of 19 at the close of the calendar year in which the taxable year of the taxpayer begins, or (II) is a student who has not attained the age of 24 at the close of such calendar year. Except as provided in subsection (b), the amendments made by this title shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1996. SECTION 1.
