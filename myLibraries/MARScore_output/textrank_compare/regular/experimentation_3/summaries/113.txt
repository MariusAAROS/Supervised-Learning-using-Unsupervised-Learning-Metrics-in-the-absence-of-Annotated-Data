In order to promote human and economic development and poverty alleviation in eligible poor countries (as defined in section 1626(c)), the Secretary of the Treasury shall commence immediate efforts within the Paris Club of Official Creditors, as well as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (World Bank), and the other international financial institutions (as defined in section 1701(c)(2)), to ensure that the provision of debt cancellation to the countries is not conditioned on any agreement by such a country to implement or comply with policies that deepen poverty or degrade the environment, including any policy that (1) implements or extends user fees on primary education or primary health care, including prevention and treatment efforts for HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and infant, child, and maternal wellbeing; (2) provides for increased cost recovery from poor people to finance basic public services such as education, health care, or sanitation; (3) would have the effect of increasing the cost to consumers with incomes of less than $2 per day for access to clean drinking water through (A) decreased public subsidy for water supply, treatment, disposal, distribution, or management; (B) reduced intrasectoral or intersectoral subsidization of residential water consumers with incomes of less than $2 per day; (C) reduced government ability to regulate; or (D) mandated privatization of water; or (4) undermines workers' ability to exercise effectively their internationally recognized worker rights, as defined under section 526(e) of the Foreign Operations, Export Financing and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1995 (22 U.S.C. 262p4p). In order to achieve multilateral debt cancellation and promote human and economic development and poverty alleviation in eligible poor countries, the Secretary of the Treasury shall commence immediate efforts, within the Paris Club of Official Creditors, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (World Bank), and the other international financial institutions (as defined in section 1701(c)(2)), to accomplish the following: (A) Each international financial institution shall cancel all debts owed to the institution by eligible poor countries. Within 1 year after the date of the enactment of this section, the Comptroller General of the United States shall prepare and submit to the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate a report on the availability of the ongoing operations, procedures, and accounts of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (World Bank), and the other international financial institutions (as so defined) for canceling the debt of eligible poor countries. The Congress finds the following: (1) Many poor countries have been struggling under the burden of international debts for many years. (2) Many poor countries have debts that are odious because they were incurred by dictatorships that did not use the funds in ways that benefitted the population of the country. (4) The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has imposed onerous structural adjustment requirements on many poor countries as a condition of past loans and of participation in debt relief programs. (B) Any waiting period before receiving debt cancellation shall not exceed 1 month from the date of an eligible poor country's application for debt cancellation.
