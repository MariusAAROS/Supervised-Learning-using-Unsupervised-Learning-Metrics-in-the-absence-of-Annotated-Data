(3) Section 717 of title VII of such Act applies to all personnel actions affecting employees and applicants for employment in an executive agency. (9) The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit established, in the case of Hilliard v. Volcker, 659 F.2d 1125 (D.C. Cir. 1981), that the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System is an executive agency within the meaning of section 105 of title 5, United States Code, and section 717 of title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. (13) The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System has acted inconsistently with current law in suggesting, despite (A) the unambiguous meaning of section 105 of title 5, United States Code, (B) the unambiguous language title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and (C) the clear applicability of title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve in several cases brought against the Board in the courts of the United States, that the Board is not covered by title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. (12) The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System has repeatedly suggested in correspondence with the Congress that such Board is not an executive agency under section 105 of title 5, United States Code, and is therefore not covered by title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. (8) The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which is responsible for enforcing compliance with title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, has consistently and properly interpreted title VII as applying to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. (11) On October 17, 1994, a jury in the case Bennett v. Greenspan, C.A. No. 980813RMU, (Dt. D.C.) found the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve liable for racial discrimination, and retaliation, in violation of title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System shall post and keep posted in conspicuous places upon its premises where such notices to employees and applicants for employment are customarily posted, and at such other places as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission may determine, a notice to be prepared or approved by the Commission setting forth (1) excerpts from or summaries of the pertinent provisions of title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e et seq.), and (2) information pertinent to the rights and procedures applicable under such Acts to employees of, and applicants for employment by, the Board.
