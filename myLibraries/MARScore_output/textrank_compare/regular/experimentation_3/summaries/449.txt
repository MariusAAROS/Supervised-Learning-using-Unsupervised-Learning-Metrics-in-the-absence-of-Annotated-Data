A medical education entity receiving payments under the pilot project shall use such payments for the training of primary care residents, including training activities in appropriate inpatient and outpatient settings in primary care graduate medical residency training programs accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education or the American Osteopathic Association and for all relevant topics including patient care, care management, working in teams, supervision, and quality improvement. Subject to paragraph (3), a medical education entity receiving funds under the pilot project, with respect to a primary care graduate medical residency training program, shall continue to receive funding under this section (even after the last day of the project), with respect to each primary care resident who is enrolled under such program while the entity is participating in such project, to the extent and in such amounts necessary to allow for the full duration of training, subject to subsection (f)(2), of such primary care resident. Payments in addition to the payments described in paragraph (2) may be made under the pilot project for primary care graduate medical residency training programs that (A) operate in sites and areas that are underserved by primary care physicians; or (B) change their training sites to include those areas. If the Secretary determines that any of the models tested under the pilot project under this section enhance the quality, quantity, and distribution of primary care physicians for Medicare beneficiaries, the Secretary may initiate comparable primary care training projects. The Secretary of Health and Human Services (in this section referred to as the Secretary) shall conduct a pilot project under the Medicare program under title XVIII of the Social Security Act, in accordance with the provisions of this section, to test models for providing payment under such title for direct graduate medical education and indirect medical education to medical education entities, which entities are not otherwise eligible to receive such payments under the Medicare program, for the costs of training primary care residents. Under the pilot project, the Secretary shall establish a process under which payments are made to each medical education entity participating under such project for direct graduate medical education and indirect medical education costs with respect to primary care residents enrolled under a primary care graduate medical residency training program operated pursuant to a model of such entity under subsection (c) instead of any payment or adjustment that would otherwise be made to a participant hospital (as defined in subsection (m)) of such entity for indirect and direct graduate medical education costs under subsections (d)(5)(B) and (h) of section 1886 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395ww) during the period of participation of such entity in such project. Payments shall only be made for training primary care residents up to the initial board certification of such residents, except that with respect to training in geriatric medicine, payments may also be made for a fellowship after initial board certification.
