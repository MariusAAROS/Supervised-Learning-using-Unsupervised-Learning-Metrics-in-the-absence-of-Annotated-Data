In furtherance of the purposes of the Wilderness Act (16 U.S.C. 1131 et seq.), certain lands within the Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado, which comprise approximately acres, as generally depicted on the map titled Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado Wilderness Boundaries and dated June 2005, are hereby designated as wilderness and, therefore, as a component of the National Wilderness Preservation System. Upon publication in the Federal Register of a notice by the Secretary of the Interior that all uses of a parcel of potential wilderness lands inconsistent with the Wilderness Act have ceased, the parcel shall be included in the Rocky Mountain National Park Wilderness designated by subsection (a) and managed as provided in section 3. This Act may be cited as the Rocky Mountain National Park Wilderness Act. The purpose of this Act is to include in the National Wilderness Preservation System certain lands within the Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado, in order to protect the enduring scenic and historic wilderness character and unique wildlife values of the lands as well as the scientific, educational, inspirational, and recreational resources, values, and opportunities of the lands.
