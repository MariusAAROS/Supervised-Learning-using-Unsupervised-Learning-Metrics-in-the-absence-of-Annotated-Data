Congress finds the following: (1) The United Nations Human Rights Council (in this section referred to as the UNHRC) has long targeted Israel with systematic, politically motivated, assaults on its legitimacy designed to stigmatize and isolate Israel internationally. (2) The UNHRC maintains a permanent agenda item known as Item 7 to ensure that Israel will be criticized at every gathering of the UNHRC. (3) At its 31st session on March 24, 2016, the UNHRC targeted Israel with a commercial boycott, calling for the establishment of a database, such as a blacklist, of companies that operate, or have business relations with entities that operate, beyond Israel's 1949 Armistice lines, including East Jerusalem. (6) The recent action of the UNHRC is reminiscent of the Arab League Boycott, which also called for the establishment of a blacklist and promoted a primary, as well as a secondary and tertiary, boycott against Israel, targeting United States and other companies that trade or invest with or in Israel, designed to harm Israel, any business operating in, or doing business with, Israel, or companies that do business with companies operating in Israel.
