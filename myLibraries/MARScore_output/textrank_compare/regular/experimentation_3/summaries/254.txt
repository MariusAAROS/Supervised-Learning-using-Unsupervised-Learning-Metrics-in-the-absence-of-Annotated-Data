In carrying out the program of methane hydrate research and development authorized by this section, the Secretary may award grants to, or enter into contracts or cooperative agreements with, institutions that (A) conduct basic and applied research to identify, explore, assess, and develop methane hydrate as a commercially viable source of energy; (B) identify and characterize methane hydrate resources using remote sensing and seismic data, including the characterization of hydrate concentrations in marine reservoirs in the Gulf of Mexico or the Atlantic Ocean Basin by the date that is 4 years after the date of enactment of the Methane Hydrate Research and Development Amendments Act of 2015; (C) develop technologies required for efficient and environmentally sound development of methane hydrate resources; (D) conduct basic and applied research to assess and mitigate the environmental impact of hydrate degassing (including natural degassing and degassing associated with commercial development); (E) develop technologies to reduce the risks of drilling through methane hydrates; (F) conduct exploratory drilling, well testing, and production testing operations on permafrost and nonpermafrost gas hydrates in support of the activities authorized by this paragraph, including (i) drilling of a test well and performing a longterm hydrate production test on land in the United States Arctic region by the date that is 4 years after the date of enactment of the Methane Hydrate Research and Development Amendments Act of 2015; (ii) drilling of a test well and performing a longterm hydrate production test in a marine environment by the date that is 10 years after the date of enactment of the Methane Hydrate Research and Development Amendments Act of 2015; and (iii) drilling a fullscale production test well at a location to be determined by the Secretary; or (G) expand education and training programs in methane hydrate resource research and resource development through fellowships or other means for graduate education and training. The Secretary shall conduct a longterm environmental monitoring program to study the effects of production from methane hydrate reservoirs. SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the Methane Hydrate Research and Development Amendments Act of 2015. SEC. 2. AMENDMENTS TO THE METHANE HYDRATE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2000.
