Congress finds that (1) the Nation's beaches and coastal recreation waters are valuable public resources used for recreation by millions of people annually; (2) the beaches of coastal States are hosts to many outof State and international visitors; (3) tourism in the coastal zone generates billions of dollars annually; (4) increased population and urbanization of the watershed have contributed to the decline in the environmental quality of coastal waters; (5) pollution in coastal waters is not restricted by State and other political boundaries; (6) coastal States have different methods of testing, and parameters for evaluating, the quality of coastal recreation waters, providing varying degrees of protection to the public; (7) the adoption of consistent criteria by coastal States for monitoring and evaluating the quality of coastal recreation waters, and the posting of signs at beaches notifying the public during periods when the standards are exceeded, would enhance public health and safety; and (8) while the adoption of such criteria will enhance public health and safety, exceedances of such criteria should be addressed (for example, as part of a watershed approach to effectively identify and eliminate sources of pollution). A State shall adopt water quality criteria for coastal recreation waters which, at a minimum, are consistent with the criteria published by the Administrator under section 304(a)(1) not later than 3\1/2\ years following the date of the enactment of this title. After consultation with appropriate Federal, State, and local officials, including local health officials, and other interested persons, but not later than the last day of the 3year period beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall conduct, in cooperation with the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere, studies to provide additional information to the current base of knowledge for use in developing (1) a more complete list of potential human health risks from inhalation, ingestion, or body contact with coastal recreation waters, including effects to the upper respiratory system; (2) appropriate and effective indicators for improving direct detection of the presence of pathogens that are harmful to human health in coastal recreational waters; (3) appropriate, accurate, and expeditious methods (including predictive models) for detecting the presence of pathogens, harmful to human health, found in coastal recreation waters; and (4) guidance for the StatetoState application of the criteria to be issued under subsection (b) to account for the diversity of geographic and aquatic conditions nationwide. Based on the results of the studies conducted under subsection (a), the Administrator, after consultation with appropriate Federal, State, and local officials, including local health officials, and other interested persons, shall (1) issue, within 5 years after the date of the enactment of this title, revised water quality criteria for pathogens in coastal recreation waters that are harmful to human health, including a revised list of indicators and testing methods; and (2) review and revise such criteria from time to time thereafter, but in no event less than once every 5 years. Monitoring requirements established pursuant to this subsection shall specify, at a minimum (1) available monitoring methods to be used by States; (2) the frequency and location of monitoring based on (A) the periods of recreational use of such waters; (B) the extent and degree of use during such periods; and (C) the proximity of coastal recreation waters to known or identified point and nonpoint sources of pollution and in relation to storm events; (3) methods for detecting levels of pathogens that are harmful to human health and for identifying shortterm increases in pathogens that are harmful to human health in coastal recreation waters, including in relation to storm events; and (4) conditions and procedures under which discrete areas of coastal recreation waters may be exempted by the Administrator from the monitoring requirements of this subsection, if the Administrator determines that an exemption will not impair compliance with the applicable water quality criteria for those waters and protection of public safety. The Administrator shall provide technical assistance to States for the implementation of uniform assessment and monitoring procedures for floatable materials in coastal recreation waters and specify the conditions under which the presence of floatable material will constitute a threat to public health and safety. Not later than 4 years after the date of the enactment of this title, and periodically thereafter, the Administrator shall submit to Congress a report including (1) recommendations concerning the need for additional water quality criteria and other actions needed to improve the quality of coastal recreation waters; and (2) an evaluation of State efforts to implement this title.
