The panel shall (1) implement and oversee the implementation of this section; (2) promulgate (A) standards for certification of registries and operation of certified registries; and (B) standards for measurement, verification, and recording of greenhouse gas emissions and greenhouse gas emission reductions by certified registries; (3) maintain, and make available to the public, a list of certified registries; and (4) issue rulemakings on standards for measuring, verifying, and recording greenhouse gas emissions and greenhouse gas emission reductions proposed to the panel by certified registries, through a standard process of issuing a proposed rule, taking public comment for no less than 30 days, then finalizing regulations to implement this act, which will provide for recognizing new forms of acceptable greenhouse gas reduction certification procedures. The purposes of the national registry are (1) to encourage voluntary actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase energy efficiency, including increasing the fuel economy of passenger automobiles and light trucks and reducing the reliance by United States markets on petroleum produced outside the United States used to provide vehicular fuel; (2) to enable participating entities to record voluntary greenhouse gas emissions reductions; in a consistent format that is supported by third party verification; (3) to encourage participants involved in existing partnerships to be able to trade emissions reductions among partnerships; (4) to further recognize, publicize, and promote registrants making voluntary and mandatory reductions; (5) to recruit more participants in the program; and (6) to help various entities in the nation establish emissions baselines. The panel shall consist of (1) the Secretary of Commerce or the Secretary's designee, who shall serve as Chairperson; (2) the Secretary of Transportation or the Secretary's designee; and (3) 1 expert in the field of greenhouse gas emissions reduction, certification, or trading from each of the following agencies (A) the Department of Energy; (B) the Environmental Protection Agency; (C) the Department of Agriculture; (D) the National Aeronautics and Space Administration; (E) the Department of Commerce; and (F) the Department of Transportation. The standards promulgated by the panel shall include (1) standards for ensuring that certified registries do not have any conflicts of interest, including standards that prohibit a certified registry from (A) owning greenhouse gas emission reductions recorded in any certified registry; or (B) receiving compensation in the form of a commission where sources receive money for the total number of tons certified; (2) standards for authorizing certified registries to enter into agreements with forprofit persons engaged in trading of greenhouse gas emission reductions, subject to paragraph (1); and (3) such other standards for certification of registries and operation of certified registries as the panel determines to be appropriate.
