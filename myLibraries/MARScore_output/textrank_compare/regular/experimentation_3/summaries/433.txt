(ii) In the short term, biofuels can supply at least onefifth of current United States fuel demand using existing technologies and capabilities. (3) Increasing fuel prices have been a particular hardship on small, independent businesses particularly truckers and farmers, who have no choice but to pay everincreasing fuel bills while absorbing these higher costs in today's economic environment. Not later than 1 year after the enactment of this subsection, the Administrator shall promulgate regulations ensuring that, after December 31, 2010, all gasoline or diesel motor vehicle fuel sold or dispensed to consumers in the contiguous United States, on an annual average basis, contains not less than 10 percent ethanol, in the case of gasoline, and not less than 5 percent biodiesel, in the case of diesel fuel. With agricultural surpluses, commodity prices have reached record lows; concurrently world petroleum prices have reached record highs and are expected to continue rising as global petroleum reserves are drawn down over the next 25 years. SECTION 1. FINDINGS. The Congress finds as follows: (1) The over reliance of the United States on imported petroleum creates a major strategic vulnerability for the Nation, with nearly half of the energy supply of the United States dependent on foreign sources.
