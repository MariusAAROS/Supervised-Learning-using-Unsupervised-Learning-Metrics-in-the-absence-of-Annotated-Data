Each individual who was an eligible individual for the taxable year preceding any taxable year to which subsection (a) applies shall be treated as having made a payment against the tax imposed by chapter 1 for such preceding taxable year in an amount equal to the program elimination refund amount determined for the taxable year to which subsection (a) applies. In the case of an eligible taxpayer, there shall be allowed as a credit against the tax imposed by subtitle A for the first taxable year beginning in any calendar year an amount equal to the program elimination rebate amount determined by the Secretary for such calendar year. The amendments made by this section shall apply to taxable years beginning after the date of the enactment of this Act. The amount of credit which would (but for this paragraph) be allowable under this section for any taxable year shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the aggregate refunds and credits made or allowed to the taxpayer under subsection (f) with respect to such amount for the preceding taxable year. SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the Stop Legislative Automatic Spending Hikes (SLASH) Act of 2008.
