(3) Because Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis behave similarly, they are collectively known as inflammatory bowel disease. There is no known cause of inflammatory bowel disease, or medical cure. (4) It is estimated that up to 1,400,000 people in the United States suffer from inflammatory bowel disease, 30 percent of whom are diagnosed during their childhood years. (5) Children with inflammatory bowel disease miss school activities because of bloody diarrhea and abdominal pain, and many adults who had onset of inflammatory bowel disease as children had delayed puberty and impaired growth and have never reached their full genetic growth potential. (9) Delayed diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease frequently results in moreactive disease associated with increased morbidity and complications. (10) Congress has appropriated $3,480,000 from fiscal year 2005 to fiscal year 2009 for epidemiology research on inflammatory bowel disease through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (11) The National Institutes of Health National Commission on Digestive Diseases issued comprehensive research goals related to inflammatory bowel disease in its April 2009 report to Congress and the American public entitled; Opportunities and Challenges in Digestive Diseases Research: Recommendations of the National Commission on Digestive Diseases.
