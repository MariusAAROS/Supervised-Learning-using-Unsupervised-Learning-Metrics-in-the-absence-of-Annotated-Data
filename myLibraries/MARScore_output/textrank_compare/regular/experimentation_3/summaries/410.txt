The Congress makes the following findings: (1) The number of airline passengers on United States carriers is expected to grow from about 600 million per year today to about 1 billion by the year 2008. (9) A 1998 Department of Transportation study found that the large United States air carriers charge about 60 percent more to passengers traveling to or from small communities than they charge to passengers traveling between large communities. For purposes of subsection (a), the terms `unfair or deceptive practice' and `unfair method of competition' include, in the case of a certificated air carrier, an air carrier's failure (1) to inform a ticketed passenger, upon request, whether the flight on which the passenger is ticketed is oversold; (2) to permit a passenger holding a confirmed reserved space on a flight to use portions of that passenger's ticket for travel, rather than the entire ticket, regardless of the reason any other portion of the ticket is not used; (3) to deliver a passenger's checked baggage within 24 hours after arrival of the flight on which the passenger travelled and on which the passenger checked the baggage, except for reasonable delays in delivery of such baggage; (4) to provide a consumer full access to all fares for that air carrier, regardless of the technology the consumer uses to access the fares if such information is requested by that consumer; (5) to provide notice to each passenger holding a confirmed reserved space on a flight with reasonable prior notice when a scheduled flight will be delayed for any reason (other than reasons of national security); (6) to inform passengers accurately and truthfully of the reason for the delay, cancellation, or diversion of a flight; (7) to refund the full purchase price of an unused ticket if the passenger requests a refund within 48 hours after the ticket is purchased; (8) to disclose to consumers information that would enable them to make informed decisions about the comparative value of frequent flyer programs among airlines, including (A) the number of seats redeemable on each flight; and (B) the percentage of successful and failed redemptions on each airline and on each flight. (5) A 1998 Department of Transportation study found that large United States air carriers charge twice as much at their large hub airports where there is no low fare competition as they charge at a hub airport where a low fare competitor is present. (6) Complaints filed with the Department of Transportation about airline travel have increased by more than 25 percent over the previous year, and complaints against large United States air carriers have increased from 6,394 in 1997 to 7,994 in 1998. 3.
