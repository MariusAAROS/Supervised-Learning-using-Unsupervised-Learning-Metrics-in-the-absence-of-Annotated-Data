Amounts appropriated by subsection (a) to the Highway Trust Fund (1) shall be transferred from the general fund at such times and in such manner as to replicate to the extent possible the transfers which would have occurred had section 3 of this Act not been enacted, and (2) shall be treated for all purposes of Federal law as taxes received under the appropriate section referred to in such section 4081(f)(1). All provisions of law, including penalties, applicable with respect to the taxes imposed by section 4081 of such Code shall, insofar as applicable and not inconsistent with the provisions of this section, apply with respect to the floor stock taxes imposed by subsection (a) to the same extent as if such taxes were imposed by such sections. In the case of a fraction of a barrel, the tax imposed by subsection (a) shall be the same fraction of the amount of such tax imposed on the whole barrel. If (1) before the tax rate reduction date, tax has been imposed under section 4081 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 on any highway motor fuel, and (2) on such date such fuel is held by a dealer and has not been used and is intended for sale, there shall be credited or refunded (without interest) to the person who paid such tax (hereafter in this section referred to as the taxpayer) an amount equal to the excess of the tax paid by the taxpayer over the tax which would be imposed on such fuel had the taxable event occurred on such date. The person holding highway motor fuel on the tax restoration date to which the tax imposed by subsection (a) applies shall be liable for such tax. If the manufacture or conversion of crude oil into refined products begins before such oil is removed from the property (A) such oil shall be treated as removed on the day such manufacture or conversion begins, and (B) the removal price shall be the constructive sales price for purposes of determining gross income from the property under section 613. Each taxpayer liable for tax under section 5896 shall keep such records, make such returns, and furnish such information (to the Secretary and to other persons having an interest in the taxable crude oil) with respect to such oil as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe.
