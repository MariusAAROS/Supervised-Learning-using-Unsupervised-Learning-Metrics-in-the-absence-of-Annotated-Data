(8) Because of the dire consequences to the citizens of the United States posed by weapons of mass destruction, and because traditional arms control efforts are inadequate, it is prudent to commence a coordinated effort among local, State, and Federal emergency response organizations to develop technologies and capabilities to detect and intercept weapons of mass destruction, to equip and protect those emergency response organizations who are first on the scene, and, where necessary, to decontaminate areas where such weapons are manufactured or detonated. For purposes of this Act, the term weapons of mass destruction means chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons (whether militarized or improvised) that are designed to spread their contents through explosions or other dissemination means. Congress makes the following findings: (1) Although the United States possesses the technological means to develop and deploy defensive systems that would be highly effective in countering limited ballistic missile threats to its territory, its ability to detect and intercept weapons of mass destruction delivered by unconventional means is limited. (2) It is axiomatic that the incentive for the unconventional delivery of weapons of mass destruction will increase in direct proportion to the perceived effectiveness of theater missile and other regular military defense systems. (3) The target of weapons of mass destruction may not be military in the usual sense of the term and, as such, the threat that is posed to the citizens of the United States by chemical and biological weapons delivered by nonconventional means is significant and growing. (4) Several countries that are hostile to the United States, including Iraq, Libya, and Iran, have demonstrated an interest in acquiring the technology necessary to manufacture weapons of mass destruction. (5) In addition, the acquisition or the development and use of weapons of mass destruction is well within the capability of many extremist and terrorist movements, acting independently or as proxies, and states can transfer weapons to or otherwise aid such movements indirectly and with plausible deniability.
