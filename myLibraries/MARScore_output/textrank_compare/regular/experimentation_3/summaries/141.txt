If the committee to which a joint resolution is referred in either House has not reported the joint resolution (or an identical joint resolution) at the end of 15 calendar days during which that House is in session after the date on which the joint resolution is introduced (A) the committee shall be deemed to be discharged from further consideration of the joint resolution; and (B) the joint resolution shall be placed on the appropriate calendar of that House. When the committee to which a joint resolution is referred in either House has reported, or has been deemed to be discharged (under paragraph (3)) from further consideration of, a joint resolution (I) it is at any time thereafter in order (even though a previous motion to the same effect has been disagreed to) for any Member of that House to move to proceed to the consideration of the joint resolution; and (II) all points of order against the joint resolution (and against consideration of the joint resolution) are waived. If a motion under clause (i) is agreed to, the joint resolution shall remain the unfinished business of the House until the House disposes of the joint resolution. A vote on final passage of the joint resolution shall be taken in each House on or before the close of the 15th calendar day during which that House is in session after the resolution is reported by the committee of that House to which it was referred, or after the committee has been discharged from further consideration of the resolution. Appeals from the decisions of the Chair relating to the application of the rules of either House to the procedure relating to a joint resolution shall be decided without debate. If, before the passage by 1 House of a joint resolution of that House, that House receives from the other House a joint resolution, the procedures stated in this paragraph shall apply. The joint resolution of the other House shall not be referred to a committee.
