Each medical simulation center of excellence established under subsection (a) shall (i) provide leadership in a specific area of medical simulation technology or knowledge; (ii) enhance and expand the knowledge base within the specific area of medical simulation technology or knowledge in line with the program requirements and the longterm interests of the medical simulation community; and (iii) serve as a resource center to interested health professional schools and individuals who want to learn about medical simulation. (3) Many educational institutions and health care providers, particularly those in urban and rural settings, have difficulty acquiring medical simulation technology. Financial assistance in the form of Federal grants would significantly enhance the ability of these entities to deploy medical simulation technology and incorporate such technology into training protocols. (4) The creation of medical simulation centers of excellence to provide guidance and leadership to educational institutions and health care entities will facilitate the deployment of medical simulation technologies and the commercialization of cuttingedge medical simulation research. The Director shall conduct and support research, evaluations, initiatives, and demonstration projects, and provide grants or enter into contracts or cooperative agreements, to enhance the deployment of medical simulation technologies and the incorporation of such technologies and equipment into medical, nursing, allied health, podiatric, osteopathic, and dental education and training protocols. The Director shall establish medical simulation centers of excellence (i) to provide leadership and conduct research with respect to enhancing and expanding the utilization of medical simulation technologies and simulationbased skills training for physicians, nurses, allied health professionals, and qualified students; and (ii) to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of medical simulation research and programs. The Director shall promote innovation in medical simulation technologies and encourage development and deployment of challenging and complex medical simulation technologies and applications by (A) conducting and supporting research on the development and deployment of complex or challenging medical simulation and interdisciplinary simulation technologies; (B) identifying, in consultation with the Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Center, particularly challenging or complex medical simulation technologies and applications; and (C) developing, in consultation with the National Library of Medicine, an electronic clearinghouse of medical simulation technologies currently available and those being developed.
