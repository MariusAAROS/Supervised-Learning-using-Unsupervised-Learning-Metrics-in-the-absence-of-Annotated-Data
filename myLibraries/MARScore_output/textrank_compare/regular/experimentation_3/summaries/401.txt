The term `navigable waters' does not include (i) waters that (I) do not physically abut waters described in subparagraph (A); and (II) lack a continuous surface water connection to navigable waters; (ii) manmade or natural structures or channels (I) through which water flows intermittently or ephemerally; or (II) that periodically provide drainage for rainfall; or (iii) wetlands without a continuous surface connection to bodies of water that are waters of the United States. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency may not use a significant nexus test (as used by the Environmental Protection Agency in the document listed in section 3(a)(3) of this Act) to determine Federal jurisdiction over navigable waters and waters of the United States (as those terms are defined and used, respectively, in section 502 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1362)). The Secretary of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers, and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall not promulgate any rules or issue any guidance that expands or interprets the definition of navigable waters unless expressly authorized by Congress. A representative of a Federal agency shall only enter private property to collect information about navigable waters if the owner of that property (A) has consented to the entry in writing; (B) is notified regarding the date of the entry; and (C) is given access to any data collected from the entry. If a Federal regulation relating to the definition of navigable waters or waters of the United States diminishes the fair market value or economic viability of a property, as determined by an independent appraiser, the Federal agency issuing the regulation shall pay the affected property owner an amount equal to twice the value of the loss. Ground water shall (i) be considered to be State water; and (ii) not be considered in determining or asserting Federal jurisdiction over isolated or other waters, including intermittent or ephemeral water bodies. The term `navigable waters' means the waters of the United States, including the territorial seas, that are (i) navigableinfact; or (ii) permanent, standing, or continuously flowing bodies of water that form geographical features commonly known as streams, oceans, rivers, and lakes that are connected to waters that are navigableinfact.
