(4) While the focus of Federal student financial assistance and higher education programs has traditionally been to ensure access to postsecondary education, the Federal Government should expand its role in student financial assistance programs for postsecondary education to address this lack of persistence to baccalaureate degree completion. (5) The amount of grant assistance provided to postsecondary students is critical to their persistence and degree attainment. A grant provided to a student by an eligible institution from an award made under this chapter shall not be considered in determining that student's need for grant or work assistance under this title, except that in no case shall the total amount of student financial assistance awarded to a student under this title exceed that student's cost of attendance, as defined by section 472. (3) This lack of persistence to completion of a baccalaureate degree continues to contribute to the gap in educational attainment and ultimate income levels between disadvantaged students and their more affluent classmates. SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the William H. Gray, III, College Completion Challenge Grant Program of 1999.
