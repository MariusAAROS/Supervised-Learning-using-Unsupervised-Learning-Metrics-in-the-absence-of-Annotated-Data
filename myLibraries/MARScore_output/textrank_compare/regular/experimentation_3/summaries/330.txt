Not later than 60 days after the date of enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter until the prospective payment system for home health agencies established by section 1895 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395fff) is in effect, the Director of the Congressional Budget Office (referred to in this section as the Director) shall estimate the amount of savings to the Medicare program under title XVIII of such Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.) To the extent that such adjustments in a year would otherwise exceed the amount certified to the Secretary pursuant to subsection (b) for such year, the Secretary shall reduce the payments to home health agencies in a pro rata manner so that the adjustments do not exceed such amount. For services furnished by home health agencies for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1997, the Secretary shall provide for an interim system of limits. If the Director certifies an amount to the Secretary pursuant to subsection (b), the Secretary shall prescribe rules under which appropriate adjustments are made to the amount of payments to home health agencies otherwise made under subparagraph (L) of section 1861(v)(1) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395x(v)(1)(L)) (as amended by section 4602 of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997) in the case of outliers (A) where events beyond the home health agency's control or extraordinary circumstances, including the case mix of such agency, create reasonable costs for a payment year which exceed the applicable payment limits; or (B) in any case not described in subparagraph (A) where the Secretary deems such an adjustment appropriate. resulting from the interim payment system for home health services established by the amendments to section 1861 of such Act (42 U.S.C. 1395x) made by section 4602 of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.
