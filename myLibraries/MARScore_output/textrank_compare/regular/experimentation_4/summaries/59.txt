Congress finds that (1) there are many sites honoring Presidents located throughout the United States, including Presidential birthplaces, homes, museums, burial sites, and tombs; (2) most of the sites are owned, operated, and maintained by nonFederal entities such as State and local agencies, family foundations, colleges and universities, libraries, historical societies, historic preservation organizations, and other nonprofit organizations; (3) Presidential sites are often expensive to maintain; (4) many Presidential sites are in need of capital, technological, and interpretive display improvements for which funding is insufficient or unavailable; and (5) to promote understanding of the history of the United States by recognizing and preserving historic sites linked to Presidents of the United States, the Federal Government should provide grants for the maintenance and improvement of Presidential sites. The Grant Commission shall (A) review applications for Presidential site grants received under subsection (c); and (B) recommend to the Secretary projects for which Presidential site grants should be awarded. 4.
