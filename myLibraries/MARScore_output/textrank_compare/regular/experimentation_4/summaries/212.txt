Great Lakes Basin water crossing study and alternatives assessment. Prohibition on transport of crude oil on Great Lakes. The Interagency Coordinating Committee on Oil Pollution Research, in consultation with the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and the heads of other relevant agencies, shall (A) identify measures to respond to spills or leaks of oil in the Great Lakes; and (B) conduct an assessment of the effectiveness of such measures in preventing significant or substantial harm to the public health or welfare, including fish, shellfish, wildlife, public and private property, shorelines, and beaches of the Great Lakes system. The assessment required under paragraph (1) shall include (A) new scientific research on the impacts of a spill or leak of oil or a hazardous substance in fresh water under a wide range of meteorological and hydrological conditions, including an evaluation of the impacts of different types of petroleum, including synthetic oil from tar sands; (B) an evaluation of oil spill or leak prevention and response plans (including techniques to address submerged oil recovery and recovery in icechoked waters) in order to identify vulnerabilities and existing threats to the Great Lakes system; and (C) recommendations to foster improvements to safety technologies, spill response planning, cleanup techniques, and environmental protection systems. Section 108 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1258) is amended (1) by redesignating subsection (e) as subsection (f); and (2) by inserting after subsection (d) the following: (e) Prohibition on Transport of Crude Oil on Great Lakes. Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Transportation, working with pipeline facility owners, operators, and State governments, shall conduct a comprehensive water crossing survey of all intrastate and interstate hazardous liquid pipeline facilities that cross waterways in the Great Lakes Basin in the waters of the United States (as defined in the final rule of the Corps of Engineers and the Environmental Protection Agency entitled Clean Water Rule: Definition of `Waters of the United States' (80 Fed. The survey required under subsection (a) shall (1) produce a comprehensive map of all hazardous pipeline waterway crossings in the Great Lakes Basin, including lakes, rivers, and streams; (2) evaluate the condition and structural integrity of pipelines at each crossing, considering factors that include pipeline thickness, diameter, weld integrity, internal and external corrosion, age, pressure, control and shutoff valves, burial depths, water depths, currents, and ice cover; (3) identify risks of leak and rupture resulting from pipeline integrity failures, or any other vulnerability at the pipeline water crossings; (4) identify gaps in data and information that exist in the pipeline network in the Great Lakes Basin, and request information related to pipeline integrity or risks from owners and operators with facilities that cross lakes, rivers, and streams; and (5) produce recommendations to prevent future leaks, ruptures, and failures that could result in damage to waterways and natural resources in the Great Lakes Basin.
