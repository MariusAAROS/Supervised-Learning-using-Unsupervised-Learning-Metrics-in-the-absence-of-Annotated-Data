For purposes of clause (i), the employer or plan sponsor (or employee) shall not be construed to be engaged in direct participation because of any form of decisionmaking or other conduct that is merely collateral or precedent to the decision described in subparagraph (B) on a particular claim for benefits of a particular participant or beneficiary, including (but not limited to) (I) any participation by the employer or other plan sponsor (or employee) in the selection of the group health plan or health insurance coverage involved or the third party administrator or other agent; (II) any engagement by the employer or other plan sponsor (or employee) in any costbenefit analysis undertaken in connection with the selection of, or continued maintenance of, the plan or coverage involved; (III) any participation by the employer or other plan sponsor (or employee) in the process of creating, continuing, modifying, or terminating the plan or any benefit under the plan, if such process was not substantially focused solely on the particular situation of the participant or beneficiary referred to in paragraph (1)(A); and (IV) any participation by the employer or other plan sponsor (or employee) in the design of any benefit under the plan, including the amount of copayment and limits connected with such benefit. (3) Exclusion of employers and other plan sponsors. Subject to subparagraph (B), paragraph (1) does not apply with respect to (i) any cause of action against an employer or other plan sponsor maintaining the plan (or against an employee of such an employer or sponsor acting within the scope of employment), or (ii) a right of recovery, indemnity, or contribution by a person against an employer or other plan sponsor (or such an employee) for damages assessed against the person pursuant to a cause of action to which paragraph (1) applies. Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), paragraph (1) applies with respect to any cause of action that is brought by a participant or beneficiary under a group health plan (or the estate of such a participant or beneficiary) to recover damages resulting from personal injury or for wrongful death against any employer or other plan sponsor maintaining the plan (or against an employee of such an employer or sponsor acting within the scope of employment) if such cause of action arises by reason of a medically reviewable decision, to the extent that there was direct participation by the employer or other plan sponsor (or employee) in the decision. Nothing in the preceding sentence shall be construed to preempt vicarious liability of any plan, plan sponsor, health insurance issuer, or managed care entity. (A) Causes of action against employers and plan sponsors precluded. SECTION 1.
