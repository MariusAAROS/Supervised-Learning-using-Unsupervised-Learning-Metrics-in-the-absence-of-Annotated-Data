In the case of computer software described in subsection (a)(1) that is installed on a computer by someone other than the user of such computer software, whether through preinstallation by the provider of such computer or computer software, by installation by someone before delivery of such computer to the user, or otherwise, the notice and instructions under that subsection shall be provided in electronic form to the user before the first use of such computer software by the user. A capability of computer software described in paragraph (1) may not be enabled unless the user of such computer software provides affirmative consent, in advance, to the enablement of the capability. The requirements in paragraphs (1) and (2) shall not apply to any capability of computer software that is reasonably needed to (A) determine whether or not the user is a licensed or authorized user of such computer software; (B) provide, upon request of the user, technical support of the use of such computer software by the user; or (C) enable an employer to monitor computer usage by its employees while such employees are within the scope of employment as authorized by applicable Federal, State, or local law. Any computer software made available to the public, whether by sale or without charge, that includes a capability to collect information about the user of such computer software, the hardware on which such computer software is used, or the manner in which such computer software is used, and to disclose to such information to any person other than the user of such computer software, shall include (A) a clear and conspicuous written notice, on the first electronic page of the instructions for the installation of such computer software, that such computer software includes such capability; (B) a description of the information subject to collection and the name and address of each person to whom such computer software will transmit or otherwise communicate such information; and (C) a clear and conspicuous written electronic notice, in a manner reasonably calculated to provide the user of such computer software with easily understood instructions on how to disable such capability without affecting the performance or operation of such computer software for the purposes for which such computer software was intended. Any person collecting information about a user of computer software through a capability described in paragraph (1) shall (A) upon request of the user, provide reasonable access by user to information so collected; (B) provide a reasonable opportunity for the user to correct, delete, or supplement such information; and (C) make the correction or supplementary information a part of the information about the user for purposes of any future use of such information under this subsection. At the request of any party to an action under paragraph (1), or any other participant in such action, the court may, in its discretion, issue a protective order and conduct proceedings in such action so as to protect the secrecy and security of the computer, computer network, computer data, computer program, and computer software involved in order to (A) prevent possible recurrence of the same or a similar act by another person; or (B) protect any trade secrets of such party or participant. The term collect means the gathering of information about a computer or a user of computer software by any means, whether direct or indirect and whether active or passive.
