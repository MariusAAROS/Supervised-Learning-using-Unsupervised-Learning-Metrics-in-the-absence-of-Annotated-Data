(4) Numerous Federal courts, including the United States Courts of Appeals for the Fourth, Seventh, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits, have nevertheless invalidated State marriage laws that do not allow the licensing of samesex marriages. (6) This Act prevents that unlawful action by eliminating the jurisdiction of all courts created by Federal law, as well as the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, to adjudicate claims pertaining to the constitutionality of State marriage laws. Limitations on Federal jurisdiction (a) No court created by Federal law shall have jurisdiction, and the Supreme Court shall have no appellate jurisdiction, to adjudicate or enforce any claim pertaining to the validity, under the Constitution of the United States, of a State law, or State administrative or judicial decision, that (1) defines marriage as limited to the union of one man and one woman; or (2) refuses State recognition of or allows the State to refuse recognition of samesex marriages performed and licensed in other States. (b) To the extent that either a court created by Federal law or the Supreme Court has entered a final judgment on a claim described in subsection (a) before the effective date of this section, that judgment binds only the parties to the case. Challenging a State marriage law on the basis that it does not extend to samesex couples raises no substantial Federal question because nothing in the text or history of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States even arguably indicates a general public understanding at the time of ratification that the ratifiers had adopted a constitutional principle that invalidated State laws defining marriage as a malefemale union.
