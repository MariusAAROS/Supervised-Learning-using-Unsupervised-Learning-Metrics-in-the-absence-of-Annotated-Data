The quality component for each hospital referral area (as so defined) shall be the ratio of the quality score for such area to the national average quality score. The cost component for a hospital referral area (as so defined) shall be the ratio of the cost per beneficiary for such area to the national average cost per beneficiary. The membership of the advisory group shall at least reflect providers, purchasers, health plans, researchers, relevant Federal agencies, and individuals with technical expertise on health care quality. If the quality component for a hospital referral area (as so defined) does not rank in the top 25th percentile as compared to the national average (as determined by the Secretary) and the amount of reimbursement for services under this section is greater than the amount of reimbursement for such services that would have applied under this section if the amendments made by section 2 of the Medicare Payment Improvement Act of 2009 had not been enacted, this section shall be applied as if such amendments had not been enacted. The Secretary may use total per beneficiary expenditures under such parts in the last two years of life as an alternative measure if the Secretary determines that such measure better takes into account severity differences among hospital referral areas. SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
