The purposes of this Act are (1) to allow consumers to make a meaningful comparison between competing claims of depository institutions with regard to deposit accounts by requiring the clear and uniform disclosure of (A) the rates of interest that are payable on deposit accounts by depository institutions; and (B) the fees that are assessable against deposit accounts; and (2) to protect rights of consumers by providing a framework establishing the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of depository institutions and consumers in closing procedures for certain types of consumer deposit accounts.; (2) by inserting after section 268 the following: SEC. Congress finds that (1) economic stability would be enhanced, competition between depository institutions would be improved, and the ability of the consumer to make informed decisions regarding deposit accounts, and to verify accounts, would be strengthened if there were uniformity in the disclosure of terms and conditions on which interest is paid and fees are assessed in connection with such accounts; and (2) consumers lack meaningful choices for managing household funds because (A) despite dissatisfaction with rising account fees at some depository institutions, consumers often find it too difficult to move their funds to new deposit accounts; (B) the process of moving funds to new deposit accounts often involves several steps and substantial time to complete, and it is not always clear what the proper procedures are for closing an account at a given depository institution; (C) depository institutions have no obligation and may lack the technical capabilities to help consumers transfer automated deposits or debits from old accounts to new accounts, causing delays and confusion; (D) depository institutions may charge fees to close an account and withdraw available funds, which can impede banking mobility for lowincome consumers; and (E) some depository institutions have engaged in the practice of reopening closed accounts without the consent of the consumer. The study required under paragraph (1) shall include, at a minimum, analysis of (i) potential reforms to payment clearing and settlement systems that would enable depository institutions to notify consumers if a preauthorized recurring debit is directed to a covered account after the covered account has been closed; (ii) potential reforms to payment clearing and settlement systems that would automatically transfer any direct deposit, preauthorized transaction, or other similar scheduled activity relating to a closed covered account to another account designated by the consumer; (iii) other factors, including technological barriers, in payment clearing and scheduling systems that limit the ability of consumers to efficiently close a covered account and transfer funds to another account; and (iv) recommendations to Congress and the appropriate Federal banking agencies, including steps that the appropriate Federal banking agencies could take through rulemaking to facilitate the automatic transfer of funds from a closed covered account to another account designated by the consumer. The term `available for withdrawal', with respect to funds deposited, means available for all uses generally permitted to the customer for actually and finally collected funds under the account agreement with the depository institution or policies of the depository institution, such as for payment of checks drawn on the account, certification of checks drawn on the account, electronic payments, withdrawals by cash, and transfers between accounts. SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the Freedom and Mobility in Consumer Banking Act.
