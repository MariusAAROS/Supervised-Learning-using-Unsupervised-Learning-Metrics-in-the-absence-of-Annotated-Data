If a deduction under section 151 with respect to an individual is allowed to another taxpayer for a taxable year beginning in the calendar year in which such individual's taxable year begins (A) no credit shall be allowed under subsection (a) to such individual for such individual's taxable year, and (B) qualified tuition expenses paid by such individual during such individual's taxable year shall be treated for purposes of this section as paid by such other taxpayer. There shall be allowed as a credit against the tax imposed by this subtitle for the taxable year an amount equal to the qualified tuition expenses paid by the taxpayer during the taxable year (for education furnished during any academic period beginning in such taxable year). If qualified tuition expenses are paid by the taxpayer during a taxable year for an academic period which begins during the first 3 months following such taxable year, such academic period shall be treated for purposes of this section as beginning during such taxable year. The term `qualified tuition expenses' means tuition required for the enrollment or attendance of (i) the taxpayer, (ii) the taxpayer's spouse, or (iii) any dependent of the taxpayer with respect to whom the taxpayer is allowed a deduction under section 151, at an eligible educational institution for courses of instruction of such individual at such institution. No credit shall be allowed under subsection (a) to a taxpayer with respect to the qualified tuition expenses of an individual unless the taxpayer includes the name and taxpayer identification number of such individual on the return of tax for the taxable year. The amount of qualified tuition expenses otherwise taken into account under subsection (a) with respect to an individual for an academic period shall be reduced by the sum of any amounts paid for the benefit of such individual which are allocable to such period as (A) a qualified scholarship which is excludable from gross income under section 117, (B) an educational assistance allowance under chapter 30, 31, 32, 34, or 35 of title 38, United States Code, or under chapter 1606 of title 10, United States Code, and (C) a payment (other than a gift, bequest, devise, or inheritance within the meaning of section 102(a)) for such individual`s educational expenses, or attributable to such individual's enrollment at an eligible educational institution, which is excludable from gross income under any law of the United States. If the taxpayer is a nonresident alien individual for any portion of the taxable year, this section shall apply only if such individual is treated as a resident alien of the United States for purposes of this chapter by reason of an election under subsection (g) or (h) of section 6013.
