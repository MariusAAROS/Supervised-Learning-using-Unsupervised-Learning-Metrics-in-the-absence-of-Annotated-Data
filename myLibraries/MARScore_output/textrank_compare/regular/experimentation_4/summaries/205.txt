For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term `recapture gain' means any gain treated as ordinary income under section 1245 or 1254 or which would be treated as ordinary income under section 1250 if such section applied to all depreciation adjustments instead of only additional depreciation. If any amount is subject to tax under section 852(b)(3)(A) for any taxable year, the amount on which tax is imposed under such section shall be increased by the percentage determined under subparagraph (B)(i)(II). The applicable inflation ratio for any asset shall be determined by dividing (A) the CPI for the calendar year preceding the calendar year in which the disposition takes place, by (B) the CPI for the calendar year preceding the calendar year in which the taxpayer's holding period for such asset began (or, if later, for calendar year 1992). For purposes of paragraph (2), if any asset is disposed of during any calendar year (A) such disposition shall be treated as occurring on the last day of such calendar year, and (B) the taxpayer's holding period for such asset shall be treated as beginning in the same calendar year as would be determined for an asset actually disposed of on such last day with a holding period of the same length as the actual holding period of the asset involved. In the case of a transfer of an interest in a partnership with respect to which the election provided in section 754 is in effect (i) the adjustment under section 743(b)(1) shall, with respect to the transferor partner, be treated as a sale of the partnership assets for purposes of applying this section, and (ii) with respect to the transferee partner, the partnership's holding period for purposes of this section in such assets shall be treated as beginning on the date of such adjustment. This section shall not apply to any sale or other disposition of property between related persons (within the meaning of section 465(b)(3)(C)) if such property, in the hands of the transferee, is of a character subject to the allowance for depreciation provided in section 167. The term `net lease property' means leased property where (A) the term of the lease (taking into account options to renew) was 50 percent or more of the useful life of the property, and (B) for the period of the lease, the sum of the deductions with respect to such property which are allowable to the lessor solely by reason of section 162 (other than rents and reimbursed amounts with respect to such property) is 15 percent or less of the rental income produced by such property.
