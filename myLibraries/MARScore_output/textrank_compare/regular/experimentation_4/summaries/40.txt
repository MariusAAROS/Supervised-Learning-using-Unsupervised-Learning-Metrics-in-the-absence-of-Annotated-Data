The center established under this section shall (A) gather and analyze extensive data on Diamond Blackfan anemia to be used for public, nonprofit, and government research initiatives involving gene discovery, ribosomal protein function, genetics of birth defects, blood cell formation (recovery from cancer chemotherapy), cancer predisposition, red cell differentiation, and a comparison of therapeutic treatments including blood transfusion, steroids, and bone marrow transplants; (B) provide thorough examinations of Diamond Blackfan anemia patients by experts in the disease to confirm diagnosis and provide genetic typing along with a multisystem evaluation; and (C) provide clinical care for DiamondBlackfan anemia. (2) DiamondBlackfan anemia patients have an increased risk of leukemia, solid tumors, and complete bone marrow failure. (E) Congenital anomalies in DiamondBlackfan anemia patients. The Congress finds as follows: (1) DiamondBlackfan anemia is a rare genetic bone marrow failure disorder, which develops in infancy and results in severe anemia due to failure to make red blood cells. (3) Fifty percent of patients with DiamondBlackfan anemia are born with birth defects, including abnormalities to the face, head, upper arm and hand, genitourinary, and heart, and 21 percent of the affected patients have more than 1 defect. (4) Treatments for DiamondBlackfan anemia, including the use of blood transfusions and steroids such as prednisone, have potential longterm side effects, including osteoporosis, iron overload (because of the transfusions), and impaired growth (because of the steroids). (5) The only cure for DiamondBlackfan anemia is a bone marrow transplant, a procedure that carries serious risks and, since most patients lack an acceptable donor, is an option for only about 25 percent of patients.
