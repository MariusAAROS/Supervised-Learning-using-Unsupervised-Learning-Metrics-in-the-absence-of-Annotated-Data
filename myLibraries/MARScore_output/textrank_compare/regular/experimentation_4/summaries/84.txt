(7) In 1993, Congress revoked the authority of the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make a public health determination regarding HIV status as grounds for inadmissibility for potential foreign students, tourists, refugees, and immigrants to the United States by specifically designating infection with the etiologic agent for acquired immune deficiency syndrome as a communicable disease of public health significance under section 212(a)(1)(A)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. (6) In 1991, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, after conducting a public health analysis, proposed ending the HIV travel and immigration ban by removing HIV from the list of communicable diseases of public health significance. Not later than 15 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall convene a panel of public health experts, including nongovernmental experts, to review all policies regarding HIV as a communicable disease of public health significance under section 212(a)(1)(A)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1182 (a)(1)(A)(i)), including (1) the results of the last analysis of the policy conducted by the Public Health Service; and (2) a 60day public comment period initiated after sufficient public notice in the Federal Register. Not later than 90 days after initiating the review under subsection (a), the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall (1) make a determination regarding the continued listing of HIV as a communicable disease of public health significance under section 212(a)(1)(A)(i) of such Act; (2) submit a report to Congress containing the results of such review, including (A) the determination reached by the review process; (B) the rationale for the determination; (C) the anticipated public health impact of the determination in relation to other communicable diseases; (D) the estimated costs of implementing the determination; (E) the names and affiliations of members of the review panel; and (F) a brief summary of the public comments; and (3) make the report described in paragraph (2) available to the public. The 2006 Consolidated Version of the United Nation's International Guidelines on HIV/AIDS and Human Rights, produced jointly by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and UNAIDS, states There is no public health rationale for restricting liberty of movement or choice of residence on the grounds of HIV status. Applicants for permanent residence and refugee status are required to be tested for HIV infection. Congress makes the following findings: (1) Under Federal immigration law, prospective immigrants, foreign students, refugees, and tourists who are infected with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) are prohibited from entering the United States.
