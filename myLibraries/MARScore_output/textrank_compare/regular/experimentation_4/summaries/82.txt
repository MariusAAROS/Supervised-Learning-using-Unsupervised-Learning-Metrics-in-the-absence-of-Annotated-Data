A State may extend the initiative of such health system upon approval of a new action plan to extend, improve, or expand the initiative, if the State determines that the initiative has proved effective, taking into account the report submitted under subparagraph (B). In this section, the term `qualifying State' means a State with a State plan amendment approved under this section that (I) has in effect an agreement with one or more qualified community health system initiatives; and (II) in any fiscal year other than the first fiscal year for which such State receives an allocation under subparagraph (C) that is not re allocated under subparagraph (D), has a Health Disparities Elimination Program established under this section that, as determined by the Secretary, has made measurable progress towards meeting the State's goals, as described under subsection (b)(1), based on reports and evaluations submitted under subsection (d). Of the total amount appropriated for this section for a fiscal year, the Secretary shall, except as provided in subparagraph (D), allocate for such fiscal year to each State an amount in proportion to the ratio of (i) the State's total expenditures under the State plan under this title in the most recent fiscal year for which complete expenditure data is available; to (ii) the sum of all States' total expenditures under all State plans under this title in the fiscal year described in clause (i). If the Secretary determines, on the basis of information available on the first day of a fiscal year, that any allocation under subparagraph (C) to a State for such fiscal year will not be required because a State does not have a State plan amendment approved under subsection (b) for such fiscal year, then such State's allocation shall be treated as an unused allocation for such fiscal year and reallocated in accordance with subparagraph (E)(i). In addition to the allocation available to a State under subparagraph (C), the Secretary shall allocate to each qualifying State for a fiscal year, out of the sum of unused allocations, as described in subparagraph (D), for such fiscal year, an amount in proportion to the ratio of (I) each such State's total expenditures under the State plan under this title in the most recent fiscal year for which complete expenditure data is available; to (II) the sum of all such States' total expenditures under all State plans of such States under this title in the fiscal year described in subclause (I). (2) Priority in selection of health systems for participation. In selecting qualified community health systems to establish an initiative under a State plan amendment approved under this section, the State shall give priority to health systems (A) that have submitted action plans (under paragraph (1)) that include the use of evidencebased interventions shown to reduce or eliminate health disparities; (B) that demonstrate the potential to have a high impact in the elimination of health disparities, improved health care access, improved health outcomes, or health care savings compared to the total incentive funding requested; (C) that have prior experience working on projects with the goal of reducing health disparities; (D) that demonstrate longterm commitment to providing health services to the target population or populations; and (E) with a demonstrated need for additional financial resources in order to strengthen and advance existing efforts of the health system to reduce health disparities.
