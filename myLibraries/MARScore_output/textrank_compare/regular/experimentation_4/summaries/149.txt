Positive results of such coordination include increased retention in school, improved educational outcomes, and the cognitive, emotional, and behavioral development of such children. In carrying out the activities described in subsection (a), the agency shall (1) coordinate such activities with appropriate social services providers, health (including mental health) providers, child welfare organizations, and juvenile justice organizations; (2) ensure that a sufficient number of children are provided services in order to produce results that are measurable and reliable under evaluations of such activities conducted pursuant to section 698; (3) ensure that not more than 5 percent of the amount of a grant is used for administrative expenses, including expenses related to the collection of data; (4) ensure that such activities do not adversely affect school attendance, dropout rates, classroom behavior, academic achievement, or the general welfare of students who receive special education and related services; (5) ensure that such activities do not result in increased segregation of students receiving special education classes from students in the general education program or curriculum of the school; and (6) ensure that such activities are culturally competent and are evidencedbased. (2) It is estimated that up to 19 percent of the total number of students in elementary and secondary schools in the United States exhibit symptoms of emotional disturbance or symptoms of other mental health conditions, but only 1 percent of such students are properly identified as such and receive necessary services.
