Every 2 years, the Secretary shall submit a report to Congress that includes (1) efforts underway by the Department of the Interior to decrease greenhouse gas emissions from covered operations on Federal lands and waters; and (2) plans for future reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from covered operations on Federal lands and waters. Information made available under this section shall be presented in a format that (1) translates such amounts and portions into emissions of metric tons of greenhouse gases expressed in carbon dioxide equivalent using both the 20year and 100year Global Warming Potentialweighted emission values; (2) for energy produced from solar, wind, and geothermal projects, includes an estimate of the greenhouse gas emissions that would result from production of the same amount of energy from fossil fuel resources; and (3) allows (A) downloading in a machine readable format; and (B) accessing the information without payment of any fee or other charge. The term fossil fuel means all natural fuels, including oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids, and coal. Not later than one year after the date of the enactment of this Act, if the Secretary of the Interior determines that revisions or promulgation of rules are needed to implement section 2 with regard to methane emissions, the Secretary shall initiate a process under the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act of 1982 (30 U.S.C. 1711 et seq.), the Mineral Leasing Act (30 U.S.C. 181 et seq.), or other applicable law to promulgate regulations to require accurate measuring and reporting to the Secretary, by each holder of a lease for the production of fossil fuels on Federal land, of the actual amount of methane gas produced under such lease, including all such gas not sold by or on behalf of the lessee. SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the Transparency in Energy Production Act of 2016.
