Nothing in this subtitle affects the authority of any State or political subdivision of a State (1) to enact or enforce (or continue in effect) any law concerning a refund value on containers other than beverage containers; or (2) to regulate redemption and other centers that purchase empty beverage containers from beverage retailers, consumers, or other persons. The term `beverage distributor' means a person who sells or offers for sale in interstate commerce to beverage retailers beverages in beverage containers for resale. The term `beverage retailer' means a person who (i) purchases from a beverage distributor beverages in beverage containers for sale to a consumer; or (ii) sells or offers to sell in commerce beverages in beverage containers to a consumer. The Administrator shall promulgate regulations establishing uniform standards for the size and location of the refund value statement on beverage containers. A retailer may limit the total number of beverage containers which the retailer will accept from any one consumer or other person in any one business day to 240 containers, or any other number greater than 240. A retailer may refuse to accept beverage containers during no more than 8 hours in any one business day. If a retailer refuses to accept beverage containers under this subsection, the hours during which the retailer would accept containers shall be conspicuously posted.
