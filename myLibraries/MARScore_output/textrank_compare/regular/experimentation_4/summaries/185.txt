Congress makes the following findings: (1) The Federal Communications Commission has assigned 21 1 as the national telephone number for telephone service for information and referral on human services, declaring that 21 1 best satisfies the public interest in allotting the limited resource of this abbreviated number. (11) Rapid deployment nationwide of 211 telephone service as a means of access to information about and referral on human services requires collaboration among State governments, comprehensive and specialized information and referral centers, human service organizations and service providers, emergency management and homeland security officials, telephone companies, and other relevant entities. Amounts awarded as grants or subgrants under this section shall be used solely to make available 211 telephone service for community information and referral on human services, including telephone connections between families and individuals seeking such services and the providers of such services. The term information and referral center means a center that (A) maintains a database of providers of human services in a State or locality; (B) assists individuals, families, and communities in identifying, understanding, and accessing the providers of human services and the human services offered by the providers of such services; and (C) tracks types of calls referred and received to document the demands for services. This desire, together with a desire to donate to organizations which provide human services, are among the reasons to contact a center which provides information and referral on volunteer opportunities and human services. The Secretary of Commerce shall award a grant to each State to carry out a program for the purpose of making available throughout such State 211 telephone service for information and referral on human services. An application on behalf of a State under this subsection shall contain information as follows: (A) Information on the program to be carried out by the lead entity of the State in order to plan to make available throughout the State 211 telephone service for information and referral on human services, including information on the manner in which the lead entity will develop, sustain, and evaluate the program.
