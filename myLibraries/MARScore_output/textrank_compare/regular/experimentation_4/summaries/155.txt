(4) The Attorney General shall conduct mandatory ballistics testing of all firearms obtained or in the possession of their respective agencies. Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3), the amendment made by subsection (a) shall take effect on the date on which the Attorney General, in consultation with the Board of the National Integrated Ballistics Information Network, certifies that the ballistics system used by the Department of Justice is sufficiently developed to support mandatory ballistics testing of new firearms.
