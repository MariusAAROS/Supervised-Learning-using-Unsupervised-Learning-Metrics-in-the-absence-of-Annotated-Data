It is the purpose of this Act (1) to establish a single agency, the Food Safety Administration, that will be responsible for the regulation of food safety and labeling and for conducting food safety inspections to ensure, with reasonable certainty, that no harm will result from the consumption of food, by preventing food borne illnesses due to microbial, natural, or chemical hazards in food; and (2) to transfer to the Food Safety Administration the food safety, labeling, and inspection functions currently performed by other Federal agencies, to achieve more efficient management and effective application of Federal food safety laws for the protection and improvement of public health. The Administrator shall administer and enforce the food safety laws for the protection of the public health and shall oversee the following functions of the Administration: (1) Implementation of Federal food safety inspection, enforcement, and research efforts, based on scientifically supportable assessments of risks to public health. (4) The Federal food safety system is fragmented, with at least 12 primary Federal agencies governing food safety. (D) The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.), with regard to food safety, labeling, and inspection under that Act. (E) Such other laws and portions of laws regarding food safety, labeling, and inspection as the President may designate by Executive order as appropriate to consolidate under the administration of the Administration.
