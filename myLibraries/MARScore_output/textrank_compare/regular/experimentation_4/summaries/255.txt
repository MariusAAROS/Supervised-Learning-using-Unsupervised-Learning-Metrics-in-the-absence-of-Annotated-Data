Any eligible employee who uses paid vacation time shall be entitled, on return from using such paid vacation time, to be restored by the employer to the position of employment held by such eligible employee when such paid vacation time commenced. Subject to subparagraph (B), an eligible employee using paid vacation time shall be compensated at the rate at which such eligible employee would be compensated if not using paid vacation time. Any employment benefits offered to an eligible employee, when such eligible employee is not using paid vacation time, shall continue to be offered to such eligible employee when such eligible employee is using paid vacation time. Such continued employment benefits shall be offered at the same level and under the same conditions as employment benefits offered to such eligible employee when such eligible employee is not using paid vacation time. If the employer requires an eligible employee to contribute to the cost of the benefits described in subparagraph (A), the employer may require that such eligible employee contribute to such cost during the use of paid vacation time at the same rate as the rate at which such eligible employee would otherwise be required to contribute if not using paid vacation time. An employer's liability for a violation under this Act shall be, as the case may be (i) the amount of unpaid vacation time owed to such employee under this section, and an additional equal amount as liquidated damages; or (ii) compensation in accordance with subsection (d) for any uncompensated unpaid vacation time used by the eligible employee, and an additional equal amount as liquidated damages. The term eligible employee means an employee who (A) has been employed for not less than 1 year by the employer providing the paid vacation time under section 3; and (B) through such employment, has provided not less than 1,250 hours of service to such employer during the previous year.
