The Tohono O'odham Nation is now trying to have these lands taken into trust status by the Secretary of the Interior pursuant to the Gila Bend Indian Reservation Lands Replacement Act of 1986 (Gila Bend Act), and has asked the Secretary to declare these lands eligible for gaming, thereby allowing the Indian tribe to conduct Las Vegas style gaming on the lands. Such lands may be used for other forms of economic development by the Tohono O'odham Nation. Section 6(d) of Public Law 99503 is amended by inserting except that no class II or class III gaming activities, as defined in section 4 of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (25 U.S.C. 2703), may be conducted on such land if such land is located north of latitude 33 degrees, 4 minutes north after shall be deemed to be a Federal Indian Reservation for all purposes. (4) Since 1986, the Tohono O'odham Nation has purchased more than 16,000 acres of land. (5) Beginning in 2003, the Tohono O'odham Nation began taking steps to purchase approximately 134.88 acres of land near 91st and Northern Avenue in Maricopa County, within the City of Glendale (160 miles from the Indian tribe's headquarters in Sells).
