Beginning in fiscal year 2010, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall make grants to water systems to assist in planning, designing, constructing, implementing, or maintaining any program, strategy, or infrastructure improvement (1) to conserve water or increase water use efficiency; (2) to carry out water metering to measure water efficiency effectiveness of a water efficiency program; (3) to preserve or improve water quality; (4) to enhance water management by increasing source water preservation and protection, or natural or engineered green infrastructure in the management, conveyance, or treatment of water, wastewater, or stormwater; (5) to increase energy efficiency or the use and generation of renewable energy in the management, conveyance, or treatment of water, wastewater, or stormwater; (6) to support the adoption and use of advanced water treatment, water supply management, or water demand management technologies or processes (such as those used in water reuse and recycling or adaptive conservation pricing) that maintain or increase water supply or improve water quality; (7) to complete studies or assessments to project how climate change may impact the future operations and sustainability of the water system; or (8) to carry out any other activity or project to address any ongoing or forecasted, based on the best available research and data, climaterelated impact on the water quality or quantity of a region of the United States that increases the resiliency of a water system to the impacts of climate change. In carrying out the process, the Administrator shall (1) give priority to applications that (A) are submitted by water systems that are, based on the best available research and data, at the greatest and most immediate risk of facing significant climaterelated negative impacts on water quality or quantity; (B) will impact the largest numbers of water users; and (C) will provide the greatest benefit per dollar expended; (2) solicit applications from water systems that are (A) located in all regions of the United States; and (B) facing varying risks as a result of climate change; and (3) provide for solicitation and consideration of public input in the development of criteria used in evaluating applications.
