The amendments made by subsection (a) apply to child health assistance provided on or after October 1, 2001. The additional allotments provided under subsection (b) to a State for a fiscal year may be (1) combined with the State's allotment for the fiscal year determined under section 2104 and used to provide child health assistance to all targeted lowincome children under the State child health plan; or (2) used for (A) a premium assistance program under which the State pays part of the premiums for coverage of a child who is eligible for child health assistance under group health insurance or a group health plan in accordance with subsection (d); and (B) reasonable planning and implementation costs specified by the State under subsection (a)(2) without regard to the limitation on such costs under section 2105(c)(2)(A). With respect to $617,000,000 of the amount available for the additional allotments under subsection (e) for a fiscal year, the Secretary shall allot an amount to each State with a State child health plan approved under this title that satisfies the requirements of paragraph (1)(A) and, if applicable, paragraph (2) of subsection (a) (A) in the case of such a State other than a commonwealth or territory described in subparagraph (B), an amount determined to bear the same ratio to $617,000,000 as the State's allotment under section 2104(b) (determined without regard to section 2104(f)) bears to 98.95 percent of the total amount of the allotments determined under section 2104(b) for such States for such fiscal year; and (B) in the case of a commonwealth or territory described in section 2104(c)(3), determined to bear the same ratio to $617,000,000 as the commonwealth's or territory's allotment under section 2104(c) bears to 1.05 percent of the total amount of the allotments determined under section 2104(c) for commonwealths and territories for such fiscal year. Except as provided in subparagraph (B), amounts allotted to a State under paragraph (1) and, if applicable, paragraph (2) for a fiscal year shall remain available for expenditure by the State through the end of the second succeeding fiscal year. For the purpose of providing additional allotments under this section to States that meet the requirements of subsection (a), there is appropriated, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, for each of fiscal years 2002 through 2011, $1,000,000,000.
