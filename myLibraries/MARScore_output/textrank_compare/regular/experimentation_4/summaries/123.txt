(9) In the last 5 years, transplant assembly facilities in the United States that are owned or controlled by persons from Japan have not shifted significantly their procurement to traditional United States producers of motor vehicle parts, as illustrated by the fact that (A) the United States automotive parts trade deficit with Japan grew between 1985 and 1990 at an annual average rate of 17 percent and totaled $9,800,000,000 in 1992; and (B) only 12.5 percent of the customs value of vehicles manufactured in such transplant facilities in the United States is based on parts produced by traditional United States motor vehicle parts producers, while 35.1 percent of such value is based on imports from Japan and 32.4 percent of such value is based on purchases from Japaneseaffiliated parts producers located in the United States. (14) In the 1991 National Trade Estimates Report, the United States Trade Representative listed close and durable relationships between Japanese motor vehicle makers and suppliers as a barrier to United States motor vehicle parts sales in Japan. The aggregate quantity of Japanese motor vehicles and Japanese motor vehicle parts that may be entered into the United States, during the first calendar year for which an import restriction implementation period is in effect, may not exceed the aggregate quantity of such motor vehicles and the aggregate quantity of such motor vehicle parts entered into the United States during 1993, reduced by 20 percent. (6) Since 1986 the United States Government has engaged, with little result, in a negotiating process with the Government of Japan to obtain fair access to the markets of that nation for United States producers of motor vehicle parts and manufacturers of motor vehicles. (7) Despite these negotiating efforts, in 1992 the United States posted a $49,400,000,000 trade deficit with Japan of which over $30,000,000,000 was accounted for by the automotive sector deficit ($9,800,000,000 of which was attributable to motor vehicle parts), and there is little evidence that the Japanese Government is seriously trying to eliminate such deficits which are detrimental to the United States economy and jobs. (8) In addition to transplant assembly facilities in the United States that are owned or controlled by Japanese persons, motor vehicles and motor vehicle parts are being imported from Japan into the United States in such increased quantities and under such conditions as to cause, or threaten to cause, serious injury to domestic manufacturers of like or directly competitive products and to the domestic workers producing such products. (17) The home market for motor vehicles and motor vehicle parts in Japan remains largely closed to all foreign manufacturers whose combined market share equals no more than 3 percent.
