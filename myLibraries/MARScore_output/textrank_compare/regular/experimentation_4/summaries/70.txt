With respect to natural gas which is imported into the United States from a nation with which there is in effect a free trade agreement requiring national treatment for trade in natural gas, and with respect to liquefied natural gas (1) the importation of such natural gas shall be treated as a `first sale' within the meaning of section 2(21) of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978; and (2) the Secretary of Energy shall not, on the basis of national origin, treat any such imported natural gas on an unjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory, or preferential basis. (5) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to repeal or modify the authority under this section to authorize a person to import or export natural gas or to authorize facilities for the import or export of natural gas other than liquefied natural gas import terminals. The schedule shall also include all Federal and State administrative proceedings authorized by Federal law for the siting, construction, expansion, and operation of natural gas pipelines and facilities related to the transportation of liquefied natural gas or natural gas from the liquefied natural gas import terminal. Section 2 of the Natural Gas Act (15 U.S.C. 717a) is amended by adding at the end the following new paragraph: (11) `Liquefied natural gas import terminal' includes all facilities located onshore or in State waters that are used to receive, unload, store, transport, gasify, or process liquefied natural gas that is imported to the United States from a foreign country, but does not include the tankers used to deliver liquefied natural gas to such facilities. For purposes of subsection (a), the importation of the natural gas referred to in subsection (b), or the exportation of natural gas to a nation with which there is in effect a free trade agreement requiring national treatment for trade in natural gas, shall be deemed to be consistent with the public interest, and applications for such importation or exportation shall be granted without modification or delay.
