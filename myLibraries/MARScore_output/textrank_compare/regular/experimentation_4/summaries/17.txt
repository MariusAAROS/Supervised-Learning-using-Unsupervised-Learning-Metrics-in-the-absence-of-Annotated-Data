(G) Identification and implementation of maintenance and overhaul requirements for hydrogen proton exchange membrane fuel cell transit buses. All fuel cell systems and fuel cell stacks in power plants acquired, or from which power is acquired, under subsection (a) shall be assembled in the United States. In the selection of federally owned or operated facilities as a site for the location of power plants acquired under this section, or as a site to receive power acquired under this section, priority shall be given to sites with 1 or more of the following attributes: (1) Location (of the Federal facility or the generating power plant) in an area classified as a nonattainment area under title I of the Clean Air Act. All fuel cell systems and fuel cell stacks in power plants acquired, or from which power is acquired, under paragraph (1) shall be assembled in the United States. Each agency of the Federal Government that maintains a fleet of motor vehicles shall develop a plan for a transition of the fleet to vehicles powered by fuel cell technology. The Secretary of Energy shall establish a program for making grants to State or local governments for the use of fuel cell technology in meeting their energy requirements, including the use as a source of power for motor vehicles. Such program shall specifically focus on promoting the application of and improved manufacturing production and processes for proton exchange membrane fuel cell technology.
