(17) In this context of corruption and human rights abuses, trade unionists, journalists, lawyers, AfroIndigenous activists, Indigenous activists, smallfarmer activists, LGBTI activists, human rights defenders, and critics of the government remain at severe risk; and previous human rights abuses against them remain largely unpunished. The provisions of this Act shall terminate on the date on which the Secretary of State determines and certifies to the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate that the Government of Honduras has (1) pursued all legal avenues to bring to trial and obtain a verdict of those who ordered and carried out (A) the March 2, 2016, murder of Berta Caceres; (B) the killings of over 100 smallfarmer activists in the Aguan Valley; (C) the December 27, 2015, killings of Joel Palacios Lino and Elvis Armando Garcia; and (D) the May 3, 2016, armed attack on Felix Molina; (2) investigated and successfully prosecuted members of military and police forces who are credibly found to have violated human rights, and ensured that the military and police cooperated in such cases, and that such violations have ceased; (3) withdrawn the military from domestic policing, in accordance with the Honduran Constitution, and ensured that all domestic police functions are separated from the command and control of the Armed Forces of Honduras and are instead directly responsible to civilian authority; (4) established that it protects effectively the rights of trade unionists, journalists, human rights defenders, Indigenous, AfroIndigenous, smallfarmer, and LGBTI activists, critics of the government, and other civil society activists to operate without interference; and (5) taken effective steps to fully establish the rule of a law and to guarantee a judicial system that is capable of investigating, prosecuting, and bringing to justice members of the police and military who have committed human rights abuses. Congress finds the following: (1) The Honduran police are widely established to be deeply corrupt and commit human rights abuses, including torture, rape, illegal detention, and murder, with impunity. (4) International human rights bodies have reported that the Honduran military and police commit human rights abuses, including killings, with impunity. However, to date there has been minimal and only token progress in effectively prosecuting members of the police involved in corruption and human rights abuses, and the reported separations have not been independently verified. (8) Further examples abound of human rights abuses by the military: in July 2013 members of the Armed Forces shot and killed Tomas Garcia, a Lenca Indigenous activist, and injured his son while they were peacefully protesting a dam project; in May 2014, nine members of the Ninth Infantry reportedly tortured and killed Amado Maradiaga Quiroz and tortured his son, Milton Noe Maradiaga Varela. Since the creation of the Military Police allegations of human rights abuses by the military have increased notably, reports Human Rights Watch.
