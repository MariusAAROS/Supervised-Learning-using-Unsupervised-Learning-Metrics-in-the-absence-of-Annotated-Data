It is the purpose of this Act to protect women's health by ensuring that abortion services will continue to be available and that abortion providers are not singled out for medically unwarranted restrictions that harm women by preventing them from accessing safe abortion services. Congress passed the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act (Public Law 103259) to address that situation and ensure that women could physically access abortion services. Though described by their proponents as health and safety regulations, many of these abortionspecific restrictions do not advance the safety of abortion services and do nothing to protect women's health. (7) These restrictions harm women's health by reducing access not only to abortion services but also to the other essential health care services offered by the providers targeted by the restrictions, including contraceptive services, which reduce unintended pregnancies and thus abortions, and screenings for cervical cancer and sexually transmitted infections. (8) The cumulative effect of these numerous restrictions has been widely varying access to abortion services such that a woman's ability to exercise her constitutional rights is dependent on the State in which she lives. (9) Congress has the authority to protect women's ability to access abortion services pursuant to its powers under the Commerce Clause and its powers under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution to enforce the provisions of section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment. The following limitations or requirements are unlawful and shall not be imposed or applied by any government because they single out the provision of abortion services for restrictions that are more burdensome than those restrictions imposed on medically comparable procedures, they do not significantly advance women's health or the safety of abortion services, and they make abortion services more difficult to access: (1) A requirement that a medical professional perform specific tests or medical procedures in connection with the provision of an abortion, unless generally required for the provision of medically comparable procedures.
