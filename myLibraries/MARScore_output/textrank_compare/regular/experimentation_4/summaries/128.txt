The plan, at a minimum, shall (1) provide for the interpretation and communication of climate data, conditions, predictions, projections, and risks on an ongoing basis to decision and policy makers at the local, regional, and national levels; (2) design, deploy, and operate a national climate observing system that closes gaps in existing coverage; (3) support infrastructure and ability to archive and ensure the quality of climate data, and make federally funded model simulations and other relevant climate information available from Global Change Research Program activities and other sources (and related data from paleoclimate studies); (4) include a program for longterm stewardship, quality control, development of relevant climate products, and efficient access to all relevant climate data, products, and model simulations; (5) establish a national coordinated modeling strategy, including a national climate modeling center to provide a dedicated capability for modeling and forecasting scenarios, and a regular schedule of projections on longterm and short term time horizons over a range of scales, including regional scales; (6) improve integrated modeling, assessment, and predictive capabilities needed to document and forecast climate changes and impacts, and to guide national, regional, and local planning and decisionmaking; (7) provide a system of regular consultation and coordination with Federal agencies, States, tribes, nongovernmental organizations, the private sector, and the academic community to ensure (A) that the information requirements of these groups are well incorporated; and (B) timely and full sharing, dissemination and use of climate information and services in risk preparedness, planning, decisionmaking, and early warning and natural resources management, both domestically and internationally; (8) develop standards, evaluation criteria, and performance objectives to ensure that the Service meets the evolving information needs of the public, policy makers, and decisionmakers in the face of a changing climate; (9) develop funding estimates to implement the plan; and (10) support competitive research programs that will improve elements of the Service described in this Act through the Climate Program Office within the Service headquarter function. The Service, at minimum, shall (A) serve as a clearinghouse and technical access point to stakeholders for regionally and nationally relevant information on climate, climate impacts, and adaptation, developing comprehensive databases of information relevant to specific regional and national stakeholder needs; (B) provide education on climate impacts, vulnerabilities, and application of climate information in decisionmaking; (C) design decisionsupport tools that facilitate use of climate information in stakeholders' nearterm operations and longterm planning (D) facilitate user access to climate and climate impacts experts for technical assistance in use of climate information and to inform the climate forecast community of their information needs; (E) provide researcher, modeler, and observations experts access to users to help guide direction of research, modeling, and observation activities; and (F) propose and evaluate adaptation strategies for climate variability and change. The Administrator shall, in consultation with the Chairmen and ranking minority members of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Science and Technology of the House of Representatives, and the National Academy of Sciences, appoint the membership of a National Climate Service Advisory Council, with members serving 4year terms, that shall include a diverse membership from appropriate Federal, State, and local government, universities, and nongovernment and private sectors who use climate information and cover a range of sectors, such as water, drought, fisheries, coasts, agriculture, health, natural resources, transportation, and insurance. (5) Increasing societal resilience to climate impacts requires understanding climate trends and variations as well as possible, understanding the impacts of climate on human and nonhuman systems, providing decisionrelevant tools based on that information, and increasing society's capacity to act on that information. (4) The United States lacks adequate research, infrastructure, and coordinated outreach and communication mechanisms to meet national climate monitoring, prediction, and decision support needs for adapting to and mitigating the impacts of climate change and climate variability.
