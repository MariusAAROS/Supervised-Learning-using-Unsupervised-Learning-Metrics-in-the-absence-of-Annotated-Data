(2) Inspections by the Food and Drug Administration of foreign device establishments are often conducted more efficiently than inspections of domestic device establishments. (3) The frequency and nature of inspections of device establishments are not consistently riskbased, and a comprehensive, transparent, riskbased approach to inspections would result in greater focus on the more significant risks to public health while reducing the burdens on establishments with a strong track record of compliance. (4) There is a lack of transparency and consistency among United Statesbased regional inspection offices with respect to the frequency of inspections of device establishments and the activities and concerns that trigger forcause inspections of such establishments. (5) Greater transparency concerning the timing and nature of routine inspections of device establishments would improve the quality and efficiency of the inspection process. (9) There is a lack of transparency in the export certification process with respect to device establishments for which FDA Form 483 has been used to document issues noticed during an inspection conducted pursuant to section 704 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 374) or establishments that have received Warning Letters in connection with such an inspection, and between domestic and foreign establishments, resulting in devices that are lawfully marketed for United States patients being denied certification for marketing in other countries. The Secretary, acting through one or more officers or employees duly designated by the Secretary, shall inspect establishments described in paragraph (1) that are engaged in the manufacture, propagation, compounding, or processing of a device or devices (referred to in this subsection as `device establishments') in accordance with one riskbased inspection schedule established by the Secretary, applied consistently across regional offices. In establishing the riskbased schedule under subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall (i) apply, to the extent applicable for device establishments, the factors identified in paragraph (4); and (ii) consider the participation of the device establishment, as applicable, in international device audit programs in which the United States participates or the United States recognizes for purposes of inspecting.
