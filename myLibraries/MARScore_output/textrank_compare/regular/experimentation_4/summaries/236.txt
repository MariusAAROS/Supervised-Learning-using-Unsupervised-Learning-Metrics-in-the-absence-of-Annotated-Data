During a period of lapsed appropriations for a federal agency that employs critical law enforcement officers, the Secretary of the Treasury shall make available to the head of such agency, out of any amounts in the general fund of the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, such amounts as the heads of such agencies determine to be necessary to continue to provide pay and allowances (without interruption) to such critical law enforcement officers during the period of lapsed appropriations. (2) An interruption in compensation could affect morale and cause hardship which would threaten United States security and the safety of our troops. (7) These critical Government functions cannot be interrupted due to an absence of Congressional appropriations or during periods of a Government shutdown, nor can we expect that the threats posed by violent criminals, terrorists and America's enemies will lessen during such periods of fiscal uncertainty. The term period of lapsed appropriations means any period during which appropriations are not available due to the absence of the timely enactment of any Act or joint resolution (including any Act or joint resolution making continuing appropriations) appropriating funds for the payment of the pay and allowances. SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the Strengthening Homeland Security, Intelligence, and Essential Law Enforcement Departments Act of 2011 or the SHIELD Act of 2011.
