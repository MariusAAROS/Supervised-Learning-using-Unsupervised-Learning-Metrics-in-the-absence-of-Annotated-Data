In the case of a qualified artistic charitable contribution (i) the amount of such contribution shall be the fair market value of the property contributed (determined at the time of such contribution), and (ii) no reduction in the amount of such contribution shall be made under paragraph (1). The increase in the deduction under this section by reason of this paragraph for any taxable year (i) shall not exceed the artistic adjusted gross income of the taxpayer for such taxable year, and (ii) shall not be taken into account in determining the amount which may be carried from such taxable year under subsection (d).

In the case of a qualified artistic charitable contribution, the tangible literary, musical, artistic, or scholarly composition, or similar property and the copyright on such work shall be treated as separate properties for purposes of this paragraph and subsection (f)(3).
