Such report shall include (1) a synthesis of current research in psychology, sociology, law, criminal justice, and other fields regarding persistent sexual offenders, including (A) common characteristics of such offenders; (B) recidivism rates for such offenders; (C) treatment techniques and their effectiveness; (D) responses of offenders to treatment and deterrence; and (E) the possibility of early intervention to prevent people from becoming sexual predators; and (2) an agenda for future research in this area. Congress finds that (1) rape and sexual assaults continue to be serious threats to the safety of communities across America; (2) sexual offenders are much more likely than any other category of criminals to repeat their crimes again and again, even after serving time in prison; (3) the average rape sentence is just 10\1/2\ years, and the average time served is half of that, approximately 5 years; and (4) repeat sexual offenders frequently strike in more than one State and, while States have primary responsibility for the prosecution of sexual offenders, the option of Federal prosecution provides a needed additional tool to safeguard communities victimized by these individuals. It is the sense of Congress that (1) States should more seriously consider the relatively high recidivism rate of sexual offenders when deciding whether to plea bargain with a firsttime sexual offender and whether to grant parole to sexual offenders; and (2) States should review their treatment and parole supervision programs for sexual offenders to assure that these programs are fulfilling their goals, and, if they are not, these programs should be immediately replaced or abandoned. The National Institute of Justice, either directly or through grant, shall carry out a study of persistent sexual predators. SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the Protection from Sexual Predators Act of 1997.
