There is established, within the Institute, an Office on Cancer Survivorship (in this section referred to as the `Office'), which may be headed by an Associate Director, to implement and direct the expansion and coordination of the activities of the Institute with respect to cancer survivorship research. The report shall include ways in which the Secretary will (1) standardize data between State cancer registries and the SEER program; (2) increase the portability and usability of data files from each registry for researchers and public health planners; (3) ensure data collection from the greatest number of health care facilities possible; (4) maximize the use of State registry data and data from the SEER program in State and regional public health planning processes; and (5) promote the use of data to (A) improve the health status of cancer survivors; and (B) research quality of cancer care and access to that care. (19) The Lance Armstrong Foundation, a leading national organization providing services and support for cancer survivors, defines cancer survivorship as living with, through, and beyond cancer. It is the sense of the Senate that the United States is at a point in history in which we must take the proper steps to reach the goal of making cancer survivorship the rule and cancer deaths rare by the year 2015. The Secretary is authorized to award grants to eligible entities to implement programs to educate patients and their families about (1) the availability and options of effective medical techniques and pain management technology therapies to reduce and prevent pain and suffering for those with cancer upon diagnosis; (2) the unique health challenges associated with cancer survivorship, including (A) the role of followup care and monitoring to support and improve the longterm quality of life for cancer survivors; (B) physical activity and healthy lifestyles; and (C) the availability of peer and mentor support programs; and (3) community resources available to increase access to quality cancer care. In order to receive funding under this section, a center described under subsection (a) shall maintain a program for disseminating to patients and research participants, as well as their caregivers, the latest information about (1) pain and symptom management and palliative care; and (2) the unique clinical and research challenges associated with cancer survivorship. It is the sense of the Senate that (1) the current procedure of sending 1 clinical trial through multiple local institutional review boards may not be the most efficient method for the protection of patients enrolled in the trial and may delay the process of bringing lifesaving treatment to cancer patients; (2) the National Cancer Institute should be commended for its work in centralizing the institutional review board process; and (3) the research community should continue to streamline the institutional review board process in order to bring lifesaving treatments to patients as quickly as possible.
