A person holding a liquid on the floor stocks tax date to which the tax imposed by subsection (a) applies shall be liable for such tax. A liquid shall be considered as held by a person if title thereto has passed to such person (whether or not delivery to the person has been made). No tax shall be imposed by subsection (A) on any liquid held on the floor stocks tax date by any person if the aggregate amount of liquid held by such person on such date does not exceed 2,000 gallons. The preceding sentence shall apply only if such person submits to the Secretary (at the time and in the manner required by the Secretary) such information as the Secretary shall require for purposes of this paragraph. Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, principles similar to the principles of clause (i) shall apply to a group of persons under common control where one or more of such persons is not a corporation. The tax imposed by subsection (a) shall be paid on or before the date which is 6 months after the floor stocks tax date. SECTION 1.
