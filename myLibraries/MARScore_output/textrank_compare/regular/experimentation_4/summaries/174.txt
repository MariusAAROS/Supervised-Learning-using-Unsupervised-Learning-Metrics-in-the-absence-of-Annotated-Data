All provisions of law, including penalties, applicable with respect to the taxes imposed by section 4081 of such Code on the aviation fuel involved shall, insofar as applicable and not inconsistent with the provisions of this subsection, apply with respect to the floor stock taxes imposed by paragraph (1) to the same extent as if such taxes were imposed by such section. In the case of aviation fuel which is held on January 1, 2008, by any person, there is hereby imposed a floor stocks tax on aviation fuel equal to (A) the tax which would have been imposed before such date on such fuel had the amendments made by this section been in effect at all times before such date, reduced by (B) the sum of (i) the tax imposed before such date on such fuel under section 4081 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as in effect on such date, and (ii) in the case of kerosene held exclusively for such person's own use, the amount which such person would (but for this clause) reasonably expect (as of such date) to be paid as a refund under section 6427(l) of such Code with respect to such kerosene. No tax shall be imposed by paragraph (1) on any aviation fuel held on January 1, 2008, by any person if the aggregate amount of such aviation fuel held by such person on such date does not exceed 2,000 gallons.
