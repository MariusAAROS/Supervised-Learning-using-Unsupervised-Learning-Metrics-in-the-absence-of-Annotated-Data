An eligible veteran who participates in the pilot program under subsection (a) may freely choose from which nonDepartment health care provider the veteran receives hospital care or medical services under the pilot program, except that the Secretary shall (A) ensure that each such nonDepartment health care provider maintains at least the same or similar credentials and licenses as those credentials and licenses that are required of health care providers of the Department, as determined by the Secretary for the purposes of this section; and (B) make a reasonable effort to ensure that such nonDepartment health care provider is familiar with the conditions and concerns that affect members of the Armed Forces and veterans and is trained in evidence based psychotherapy. In authorizing and monitoring such care, the Secretary shall (1) treat a nonDepartment health care provider that furnishes to such a veteran hospital care or medical services under the pilot program as an authorized recipient of records of such veteran for purposes of section 7332(b) of title 38, United States Code; and (2) ensure that such nonDepartment health care provider transmits to the Department such records as the Secretary determines appropriate. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall carry out a pilot program to furnish hospital care and medical services to eligible veterans through nonDepartment health care providers to treat injuries or illnesses which, in the judgment of a professional employed by the Department, resulted from a physical assault of a sexual nature, battery of a sexual nature, or sexual harassment which occurred while the veteran was serving on active duty, active duty for training, or inactive duty training. In this section: (1) The term nonDepartment health care provider means an entity specified in section 101(a)(1)(B) of section 101 of the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2015 (Public Law 113146; 38 U.S.C. 1701) or any other health care provider that has entered into a contract, agreement, or other arrangement with the Secretary pursuant to another provision of law to furnish hospital care or medical services to veterans.
