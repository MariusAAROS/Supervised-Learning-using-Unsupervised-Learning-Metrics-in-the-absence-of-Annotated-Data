If (I) any portion of the employee's interest is payable to (or for the benefit of) an eligible designated beneficiary, (II) such portion will be distributed (in accordance with regulations) over the life of such eligible designated beneficiary (or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of such beneficiary), and (III) such distributions begin not later than 1 year after the date of the employee's death or such later date as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe, then, for purposes of clause (i) and except as provided in clause (iv) or subparagraph (E)(iii), the portion referred to in subclause (I) shall be treated as distributed on the date on which such distributions begin. If an eligible designated beneficiary dies before the portion of an employee's interest described in clause (ii) is entirely distributed, clause (ii) shall not apply to any beneficiary of such eligible designated beneficiary and the remainder of such portion shall be distributed within 5 years after the death of such beneficiary. A trust shall not constitute a qualified trust under this section unless the plan provides that, if an employee dies before the distribution of the employee's interest (whether or not such distribution has begun in accordance with subparagraph (A)), the entire interest of the employee will be distributed within 5 years after the death of such employee. If (i) an employee became a 5percent owner with respect to a plan year ending in a calendar year which began before January 1, 2013, and (ii) the employee has not retired before calendar year 2014, such employee shall be treated as having become a 5 percent owner with respect to a plan year ending in 2013 for purposes of applying section 401(a)(9)(C)(v) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (as added by the amendment made by subsection (c)). For purposes of this paragraph, the term qualified annuity means, with respect to an employee, an annuity (i) which is a commercial annuity (as defined in section 3405(e)(6) of such Code) or payable by a defined benefit plan, (ii) under which the annuity payments are substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) over the lives of such employee and a designated beneficiary (or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of such employee or the life expectancy of such employee and a designated beneficiary) in accordance with the regulations described in section 401(a)(9)(A)(ii) of such Code (as in effect before such amendments) and which meets the other requirements of this section 401(a)(9) of such Code (as so in effect) with respect to such payments, and (iii) with respect to which (I) annuity payments to the employee have begun before January 1, 2014, and the employee has made an irrevocable election before such date as to the method and amount of the annuity payments to the employee or any designated beneficiaries, or (II) if subclause (I) does not apply, the employee has made an irrevocable election before the date of the enactment of this Act as to the method and amount of the annuity payments to the employee or any designated beneficiaries. If a designated beneficiary of an employee who dies before January 1, 2014, dies after December 31, 2013 (A) the amendments made by this section shall apply to any beneficiary of such designated beneficiary, and (B) the designated beneficiary shall be treated as an eligible designated beneficiary for purposes of applying section 401(a)(9)(B)(iv) of such Code (as in effect after the amendments made by this section).
