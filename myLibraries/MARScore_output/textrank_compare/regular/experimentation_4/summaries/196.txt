A person described in subparagraph (B) shall be deemed to have been a citizen of the United States at birth after the approval of an application filed within the United States or with a United States Embassy. An individual who becomes a citizen of the United States pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be deemed to have been a citizen of the United States at birth and shall be issued a United States Consular Report of Birth. If the Secretary of State determines that a covered individual is not eligible to be adopted by a citizen or national of the United States on the basis that the conditions described in subsection (c) are not met, the Secretary shall provide (1) a notice of intent to deny the adoption of the child to such citizen or national of the United States; and (2) an opportunity for such citizen or national to appeal the determination. Prior to the adoption, the child was an unmarried individual younger than 18 years of age (i)(I) whose biological parents (or parent, in the case of an individual who has 1 sole or surviving parent) or other person or institution that retains legal custody of the individual (aa) have freely given their written irrevocable consent to the termination of their legal relationship with the individual, and to the individual's emigration and adoption and that such consent has not been induced by payment or compensation of any kind and has not been given prior to the birth of the individual; (bb) are unable to provide proper care for the individual, as determined by the competent authority of the individual's residence; or (cc) have voluntarily relinquished the individual to the competent authorities pursuant to the law of the individual's residence; or (II) who, as determined by the competent authority of the individual's residence (aa) has been abandoned or deserted by the individual's biological parents or legal guardian; or (bb) has been orphaned due to the death or disappearance of the individual's biological parents or legal guardian; and (ii) with respect to whom the Secretary of State (I) is satisfied that the proper care will be furnished the individual if admitted to the United States; (II) is satisfied that the purpose of the adoption is to form a bona fide parentchild relationship and that the parentchild relationship of the individual and the biological parents has been terminated (and in carrying out both obligations under this subparagraph, the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, may consider whether there is a petition pending to confer immigrant status on 1 or both of the biological parents); (III) is satisfied that there has been no inducement, financial or otherwise, offered to obtain the consent nor was it given before the birth of the individual; and (IV) in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, is satisfied that the individual is not a security risk.
