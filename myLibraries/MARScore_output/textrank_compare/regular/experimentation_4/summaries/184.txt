It is the policy of the Congress to remove impediments to home investment by firsttime homebuyers by permitting owners of individual retirement plans to direct the trustees of such plans to invest plan funds as home equity or debt in the homes of such owners or in the home of family members who are firsttime homebuyers. For purposes of this paragraph, the term `qualified home purchase loan' means a loan (i) made by the trustee of an individual retirement plan at the direction of the individual on whose behalf such plan is established, (ii) the proceeds of which are used for the acquisition of a dwelling unit which within a reasonable period of time (determined at the time the loan is made) is to be used as the principal residence for a firsttime homebuyer, (iii) which by its terms requires interest on the loan to be paid not less frequently than monthly, (iv) which by its terms requires repayment in full not later than the earlier of (I) the date which is 15 years after the date of acquisition of the dwelling unit, or (II) the date of the sale or other transfer of the dwelling unit, (v) which by its terms treats (I) any amount required to be paid under clause (iii) during any taxable year which is not paid at the time required to be paid, and (II) any amount remaining unpaid as of the beginning of the taxable year beginning after the period described in clause (iv), as distributed during such taxable year to the individual on whose behalf such plan is established and subject to section 72(t)(1), and (vi) which bears interest from the date of the loan at a rate not less than 2 percentage points below, and not more than 2 percentage points above, the rate for comparable United States Treasury obligations on such date. The term `acquisition cost' has the meaning given such term by section 143(k)(3). The term `firsttime homebuyer' has the meaning given such term by section 4975(h)(3)(B). The term `acquisition' has the meaning given such term by section 4975(h)(3)(D)(i). The Congress finds that (1) it is desirable to make funds available from individual retirement plans to encourage first time home ownership, and (2) the tax and penalty on the premature withdrawal of funds from individual retirement plans are substantial impediments to making such funds available for that purpose.
