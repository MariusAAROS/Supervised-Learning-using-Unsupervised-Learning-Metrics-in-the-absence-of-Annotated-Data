(5) Over the past decade, human rights have been in steady decline in Iran. Section 302 of such Act is amended (1) by amending the section header to read as follows: support for democracy and human rights in iran; and (2) by redesignating subsections (a) through (g) as subsections (b) through (h), respectively; (3) in subsection (d), as redesignated (A) by inserting , acting through the Special Envoy, after The President; and (B) in paragraph (2), by striking (g) and inserting (h); and (4) by inserting before subsection (b) the following: (a) Special Envoy on Human Rights in Iran. The President shall appoint a special envoy for human rights in Iran within the Department of State (in this section referred to as the `Special Envoy'). The Special Envoy shall (i) support and promote international efforts to promote human rights and political freedoms in Iran, including coordination between the United States and the United Nations, the European Union, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and countries in the region; (ii) establish the regional framework described in section 304; (iii) coordinate with appropriate offices of the Department of State, the Department of Defense, the National Security Council, and such other agencies as may be necessary to coordinate the establishment and operation of the regional framework; (iv) serve as point of contact for opposition groups, diaspora groups, and nongovernmental organizations interested in advocating democracy and human rights in Iran; (v) coordinate efforts with appropriate departments and agencies of the Federal Government, international organizations, nongovernmental organizations, and individuals and organizations from the Iranian diaspora to acquire greater information and reporting on conditions in Iran; (vi) oversee funding for, and providing consultative authority with respect to, public and private broadcasting into Iran; and (vii) review strategies for improving the protection of human rights in Iran, including technical training and exchange programs. It is the sense of Congress that the United States Government should explore the possibility of a regional human rights dialogue on Iran that is modeled on the Helsinki process established by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, engaging all countries in the region in a common commitment to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms. It is the sense of Congress that the United Nations has a significant role to play in promoting and improving human rights in Iran, and that (1) the United Nations General Assembly has taken positive steps by adopting Resolution 61/176, which expresses its grave concern over the deteriorating human rights situation in Iran; (2) the severe human rights violations in Iran warrant countryspecific attention and reporting by the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the United Nations Working Group on Enforced and Involuntary Disappearances, the Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Summary, or Arbitrary Executions, the Special Rapporteur on the Promotion and Protection of the Right to Freedom of Opinion and Expression, the Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief, and the Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women; (3) United Nations member states should not support Iran as a member of the United Nations Human Rights Council until the Government of Iran has made significant progress in its human rights record, including the adherence to the Universal Declaration on Human Rights; and (4) the Special Envoy should work with the United Nations to compile accurate statistical data on social and political conditions inside Iran. It is the sense of Congress that the commitment to human rights and democracy of a national of Iran who has applied for a visa to enter the United States should be considered when determining the eligibility of such national for the visa.
