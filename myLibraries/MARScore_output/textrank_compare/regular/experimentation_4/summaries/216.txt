The persistent current account deficit weakens United States manufacturing and agriculture and causes the loss of United States jobs. Congress makes the following findings: (1) Since 1997, the United States current account deficit, the broadest measure of United States international trade, has grown substantially, both absolutely and relative to gross domestic product (GDP), increasing from $140,400,000,000 in 1997 (1.7 percent of GDP) to $791,000,000,000 in 2005 (6.3 percent of GDP). Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) and (b), whenever there is a United States current account deficit that exceeds 2 percent of the gross domestic product, then (A) for purposes of subsection (a), the President shall determine that fundamental international payments problems do exist that require special import measures to restrict imports; and (B) within 30 days after making that determination, the President shall proclaim, for the period described in paragraph (2), a temporary import surcharge under this subsection in the form of duties (in addition to those already imposed, if any) on articles imported into the United States. The period of the surcharge proclaimed under this subsection is the period beginning on the date on which the surcharge is proclaimed and ending on the date on which there is not a United States current account deficit, or there is a United States current account deficit that does not exceed 1 percent of the gross domestic product. SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the Balanced Trade Act of 2006.
