Nothing in this Act shall be construed to prevent the holder of a rightofway described in section 2 from bringing an action at any time to quiet title with respect to such rightofway under section 2409a of title 28, United States Code, nor shall any proceedings taken pursuant to this Act be deemed a prerequisite to filing any such action. In any action brought pursuant to subsection (a), the United States shall bear the burden of proof on all issues, including (but not limited to) proving that (1) the rightofway was not a public rightofway; (2) the rightofway was not accepted or established in accordance with the laws of the State where the rightofway is located or by an affirmative act of a State or political subdivision thereof indicating acceptance of the grant; (3) the land on which the rightofway is located was reserved for public use at the time of acceptance of the right ofway; and (4) the scope of the rightofway identified in the notice of rightofway exceeds that permitted under State law. Any State, political subdivision thereof, or other holder of a rightofway across public lands which was granted under section 2477 of the Revised Statutes before the enactment of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, or any person who uses or could use the rightofway for passage across such lands to access property in which such person has an interest, may file with the appropriate Secretary of the Department concerned (hereafter in this Act referred to as the Secretary) a notice of the rightofway.
