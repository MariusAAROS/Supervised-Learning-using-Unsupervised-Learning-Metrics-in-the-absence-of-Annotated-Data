The purpose of this Act is to protect the health of women and newborns by ensuring that all women eligible for coverage through the Exchanges established under title I of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Public Law 111148) can access affordable health coverage during their pregnancy. (5) Uninsured women, women with grandfathered and transitional health plans, selffunded student health plans, and catastrophic and highdeductible health plans may lack access to comprehensive and affordable maternity coverage. (2) For more than 30 years, our Nation, through the Medicaid program, has recognized that pregnant women need immediate access to affordable care, and has allowed women who meet incomeeligibility requirements to enroll in Medicaid coverage when they become pregnant. (7) Timely maternity care improves the health of pregnant women, as well as birth outcomes and the health of babies throughout their lifetimes.
