enforced mir128 expression increased the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to doxorubicin induced apoptosis and dna damage. a specific subset of dysregulated mirnas in breast cancer cells may serve as targets for gene therapy either alone or as an adjuvant treatment to current clinical protocols for breast cancer patients. emerging evidence indicates that pirna expression occurs in somatic cells [ 57 , 58 ] and piwil2 expression has been identified in human breast cancer cells. many distinct mirnas have been shown to regulate breast cancer cell proliferation , apoptosis , cancer stem cell expansion , and tumorigenesis. mir27a negatively regulated the zinc finger zbtb10 gene and myt1 , thereby promoting breast cancer cell proliferation. genomic deletion and transcriptional downregulation of snorna u50 was detected in breast cancer cell lines. high throughput deep sequencing identified a group of small rnas matching pirna sequences in human breast cancer tissues and breast cancer cell lines.
