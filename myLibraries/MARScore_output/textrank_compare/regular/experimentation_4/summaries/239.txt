(2) In 1998 there were 903 deaths from cigarette ignited fires, 2,453 civilian injuries from such fires, and $411,700,000 in property damage caused by such fires. (3) Nearly 100 children are killed each year from cigarette related fires. (5) It is appropriate for Congress to require by law the establishment of a cigarette fire safety standard for the manufacture and importation of cigarettes. Not later than 18 months after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Commission shall, by rule, prescribe one or more fire safety standards for cigarettes to reduce the risk of ignition presented by cigarettes. Except as provided in paragraph (3), in establishing standards under paragraph (1), the Commission shall use the testing methodology for determining the ignition propensity of cigarettes referred to in Relative Ignition Propensity of Test Market CigarettesNational Institute of Standards and TechnologyNIST Technical Note 1436, January, 2001Appendix D: Cigarette Extinction Method, together with any requirements specified in this paragraph. In establishing standards under paragraph (1) with respect to a cigarette that cannot be tested using the testing methodology referred to in paragraph (2) because of unique or nontraditional characteristics, the Commission shall accept a testing methodology and acceptance criterion that are proposed by the manufacturer or manufacturers of the cigarette if the Commission, after review of the application of the proposed testing methodology and acceptance criterion, determines that the cigarette has an ignition propensity equivalent to or less than cigarettes that pass the acceptance criterion referred to in paragraph (2). The Commission shall include in the rule prescribed under subsection (a) a prohibition on the stockpiling of cigarettes to which the fire safety standards in the rule will apply.
