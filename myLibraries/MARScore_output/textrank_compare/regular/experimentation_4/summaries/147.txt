Not later than 30 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the President shall instruct the Secretary of State to work with the appropriate United Nations agencies, regional organizations, nongovernmental organizations, and the broader international community to establish an international donors group to maximize resources and efficiently provide humanitarian assistance to the people of Syria. (b) Funding for Fiscal Years 2013 and 2014.Of the amounts made available to carry out the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151 et seq.) for fiscal years 2013 and 2014, such sums as may be necessary should be allocated for bilateral refugee assistance programs in the countries surrounding Syria. Not later than 60 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter, the President shall submit to Congress a detailed report on the implementation of this Act, including a description of (1) progress made as a result of humanitarian and stabilization efforts, including refugee assistance in Syria; (2) progress made toward establishing an inclusive, democratic government that protects the rights of all Syrians; and (3) key challenges, gaps, and obstacles to further enhancing stability and peace in Syria, including between Syria and its neighbors. Congress makes the following findings: (1) In March 2011, peaceful demonstrations in Syria began against the authoritarian rule of Bashar alAssad. The regime responded with terrible violence against the citizens of Syria, including the use of weapons of war, torture, extrajudicial killings, arbitrary executions, sexual violence, and interference with access to medical treatment. (2) In December 2011, the Government of Syria agreed to allow an Arab League observer group into the country to assess the humanitarian and political situation on the ground.
