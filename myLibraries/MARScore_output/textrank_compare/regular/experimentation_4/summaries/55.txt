The purpose of the Donor Bank shall be to seek and preserve donations of qualifying human stem cells and to make such donated cells available for biomedical research and for therapeutic purposes. (9) Recent scientific developments show that human stem cell research based on ethically responsible stem cell sources may lead to exponential improvements in the treatment of many terminal and debilitating conditions, from cancer to Parkinson's to Alzheimer's to diabetes to heart disease. For purposes of this Act, the term qualifying human stem cells means human stem cells obtained from human placentas, umbilical cord blood, organs or tissues of a living or deceased human being who has been born, or organs or tissues of unborn human offspring who died of natural causes (such as spontaneous abortion). The Donor Bank shall with respect to qualifying human stem cells (1) operate a registry of patients who are transplant candidates; (2) establish a system for finding donors who are unrelated to the candidate patients and are suitably matched to the patients; and (3) carry out informational and educational activities. The Secretary shall establish criteria for the Donor Bank and other entities that participate in the program under this section, including (1) quality standards and standards for tissue typing and obtaining the informed consent of donors, or the parents or legal representatives of donors as appropriate; (2) donor selection criteria, based on established medical criteria, to protect both donors and transplant recipients and to prevent the transmission of potentially harmful infectious diseases; (3) procedures to ensure the proper collection and transportation of qualifying human stem cells; and (4) standards that (A) require the establishment of a system of strict confidentiality of records relating to the identity and address of and medical information on patients and donors; and (B) prescribe the purposes for which the records described in subparagraph (A) may be disclosed, and the circumstances and extent of the disclosure. The Secretary, acting through the Director of the National Institutes of Health, may conduct and support research that uses qualifying human stem cells. For purposes of this Act: (1) The term qualifying human stem cells has the meaning given such term in section 3.
