they found that hipscs are capable of generating haematopoietic cells with phenotypic and morphological characteristics similar to those derived from hescs ; however , these hipsc derived cells exhibited a dramatically reduced capacity ( by greater than 1000fold ) to generate erythroid cells. furthermore , these erythroid cells were able to enucleate , albeit with reduced capacity compared to hesc derived erythroid cells , and were found to express functional hb ( predominantly hbf ). these hipsc derived erythroid cells were compared to those differentiated from hescs , and no significant differences were detected in terms of erythroid commitment , expression of erythroid markers , and type and functionality of hb.. revealed that while functional rbcs could be generated from hipscs , when compared to hescs , hipscs were shown to have reduced ( approximately 8fold ) amplification potential in producing mature erythroid cells. this group cultured hipscs derived from human fibroblasts with the op9 bone marrow stroma line to induce hematopoietic differentiation and followed this with selective expansion of erythroid cells in serum free media with cytokines supporting rbc differentiation. the results from this study show that it is possible to produce significant numbers of erythroid cells from fibroblast derived hipscs , and that thus cellular reprogramming could contribute to the treatment of haemoglobinopathies. to potentially avoid the issue of tumour formation and uncontrolled proliferation of ipscs , an alternative methodology known as transdifferentiation is also being considered as a potential treatment strategy.. transdifferentiation is achieved by introducing various exogenous factors into a differentiated cell , such as a fibroblast , to directly convert it into another type of differentiated cell , thereby bypassing the pluripotent state ( figure 1(b ) ). embryonic stem cells ( escs ) and adult stem cells ( ascs ) each have their own strengths and disadvantages in these strategies.
