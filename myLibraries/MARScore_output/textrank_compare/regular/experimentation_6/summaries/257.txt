along this line , it will also be advantageous to know whether genes involved in neurogliogenesis elsewhere in the cns , such as lin28 , a heterochronic gene regulating the developmental timing ( 15 ) and ezh2 , an epigenetic regulator of gene expression ( 16 ) participate in mg differentiation and coordinate the influence of the niche. , it will also be advantageous to know whether genes involved in neurogliogenesis elsewhere in the cns , such as lin28 , a heterochronic gene regulating the developmental timing ( 15 ) and ezh2 , an epigenetic regulator of gene expression ( 16 ) participate in mg differentiation and coordinate the influence of the niche. to address this challenge , the neurogenic potentials of mg need to be evaluated against the backdrop of two models , with the understanding that examples from lower vertebrates would constitute a framework , but that solutions will be unique to the mammalian retina : ( 1 ) svz / sgz model , where mg have nsc properties and thus the capacity for neuronal differentiation like radial glia derived nscs in svz and sgz. given the observations that the adult nscs are responsive to environmental cues for neuronal differentiation ( 1 ) , mg in this model should be amenable to directed differentiation along neuronal lineage through the manipulation of niche based signals by recombinant growth factors and/or small molecules. ( 2 ) extra svz / sgz model , where mg may have neurogenic potential like parenchymal astrocytes but incapable of neuronal differentiation , presumably under the influence of the non neurogenic niche. there is a significant knowledge gap in our understanding of how neurogenesis shifts to the generation of mg in the mammalian retina , information essential to navigate the cellular or molecular roadblocks to neuronal differentiation. for example , although we know that notch signaling regulates the generation of mg , how it is incorporated into the gliogenic program and to what extent it is involved in suppressing neuronal differentiation remains rather unknown ( 4 ).
