moreover , based on previous studies performed in iran , treatment of p. aeruginosa infections is a major concern for health care setting due to its high resistant rate to different antibiotics ( 12 , 13 ). although , in our investigated hospital , carbapenems ( imipenem , meropenem ) along with amikacin are the most currently used antibiotics for the treatment of p. aeruginosa infections , results of this study revealed that prescription of them should be limited. in order to optimize treatment of p. aeruginosa infections in our hospital (. also it can be mentioned as a limitation of this study ) , determination of resistance to other antibiotics like piperacillin , piperacillin clavulanic acid , ticarcillin , ticarcillin clavulanic acid , gentamicin , and cefepime , are essential to be evaluated in future studies. although in a previous study the correlation between rapd type and p. aeruginosa infection was suggested , our finding is not in agreement with these data ( 42 ). evidently , p. aeruginosa due to low permeability of its outer membrane in combination with efflux pump overexpression is intrinsically resistant to a variety of antibiotics ( 5 ). expression of different classes of extended spectrum lactamas enzymes along with aminoglycoside modifying enzymes ( aminoglycoside phosphoryltransferases , aminoglycoside acetyltransferases , and aminoglycoside nucleotidyltransferases ) , and mutation are other well characterized mechanisms for antibiotic resistance in p. aeruginosa ( 6 , 7 ). data extracted from several independent studies in iran showed that p. aeruginosa was responsible for 11%32.4% of utis , 17.2%32.4% of pneumonia , 36.7% of bsi , and 47% of wound infections ( 8 12 ).
