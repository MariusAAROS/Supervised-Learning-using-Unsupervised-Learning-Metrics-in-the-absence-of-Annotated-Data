if the shape of caries can be quantified , and the relationship between the numerical value and the condition of the lesion can be demonstrated , this information would be helpful to diagnose dental caries. an increase of the proportion of the area of discoloration corresponded to a change of the volume of caries lesion , while an increase of the fractal dimension corresponded to a change of the shape of the lesion caused by caries progression.. the correlation coefficient between diagnodent readings and the depth and the volume of caries lesions was reported to be 0.47. foti , difoti , and qlf have been tested in vivo , however , the number of clinical studies has still been small [ 15 , 16 ]. in recent years , the concept of minimal intervention ( mi ) has prevailed in dentistry. therefore , the importance of diagnosing caries at an early stage has increased. in conventional procedures ,.
