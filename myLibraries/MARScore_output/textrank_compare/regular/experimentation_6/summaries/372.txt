the world health organisation describes ms as the presence of type 2 diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance with any two of the following characteristics : obesity , high levels of triglycerides , low levels of high density lipoprotein , and hypertension. the international diabetes federation ( idf ) takes central obesity as a prerequisite for the diagnosis of ms with the association of any two of the other factors , that is , high blood pressure , abnormal blood glucose , high levels of triglycerides , and low levels of high density lipoprotein. although a number of these correlations show high levels of significance , the common variance is extremely low , suggesting that the sample size is having a major impact on the significance. obesity is increasing substantially and is one of the major contributors of disease prevalence due to its pathophysiological link to other cardiovascular risks such as hypertension and diabetes. the relationships between the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors , demographic details , lifestyle , and physiological test results were analysed using the spearman correlation test. table 7 lists the chi squared independence , odds ratios , and confidence intervals in the association between age , gender , and specific lifestyle factors in metabolic syndrome prevalence. according to the world health organization 's recent update , diabetes , hypertension , and obesity are one of the top five continuing risk factors for cardiovascular deaths in the world.
