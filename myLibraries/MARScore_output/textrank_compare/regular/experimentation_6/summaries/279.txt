its most probable position , as defined by gene expression patterns , would be from somewhere forward of the caudal limit of otx expression , which in vertebrates extends through the midbrain , to a point close to the beginning of the zone of hox gene expression. expression patterns of the same genes in larvaceans , another group of tunicates , is somewhat different yet again 13 , which further complicates the problem of determining the nature of the ancestral pattern. from the above it is clear that there is a certain plasticity in the way expression patterns of genes identified with the mhb have diverged among chordates. if , however , as argued above , the specific organizer functions of the vertebrate mhb evolved with vertebrates , why are hemichordate expression patterns so close to vertebrate ones ?. , there is a zone of ventral neuropile in some ways comparable with the ventral tegmental commissure , which forms part of the early axonal scaffolding in embryonic vertebrate brains. the transition is somewhat easier to imagine , in fact , if the starting point is an animal with circumferential expression zones of all the key patterning genes ( fig. molecular and morphological evidence together support the idea that the anterior end of the amphioxus nerve cord contains regions homologous with vertebrate forebrain and hindbrain 1,2 , though it is generally the ventral portion of these regions that are best represented 3.
