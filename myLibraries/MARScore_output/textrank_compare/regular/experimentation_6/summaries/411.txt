the 16.4 cm magnitude of the interaction term ( with its expected dependence on quantum numbers ) has been derived from band shifts and intensities for a series of levels built on 2/27 for all three isotopologues. in this work we derived a large set of experimental anharmonic constants from combination bands and in particular for the lower wavenumber vibrations from hot bands , and report a complete set of theoretically computed values. combination bands allow for a direct assignment , whereas hot bands must be identified by their intensity ( controlled by the boltzmann factor ). this helped to decide between different assignments of combination bands in a few cases where the harmonic sums were similar to each other. additionally the relative intensities of combination bands and their isotopic dependence are well predicted. this picture is also consistent with a stepwise cleavage of the double donator acceptor bond on c2f4 dissociation and its stepwise formation on cf2 recombination. more recently , borisov et al. found evidence for trans pyramidalization on extension of the cc bond also from molecular orbital calculation ( at high level : mller plesset perturbation theory of second , third and fourth order ) : the authors found that the onset is relatively sudden on cc extension to 142 pm and that the distortion lowers the energy appreciably.
