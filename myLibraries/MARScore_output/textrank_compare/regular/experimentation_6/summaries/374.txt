moreover , we found that engineered p53 mutations prevent cellular senescence and accelerate medulloblastoma formation , showing that p53 mutations lead to senescence evasion. the fact that p53 mutations , which are acquired spontaneously during medulloblastoma formation , lead to senescence evasion provides an explanation for the presence of somatic tp53 mutations in human shh medulloblastoma. using laser capture microdissection , we found that one third of all advanced medulloblastomas acquired p53 mutations that were not present in preneoplastic lesions , supporting the notion that p53 mutations allow senescence evasion and medulloblastoma progression ( fig.. further supporting the idea that senescence evasion is necessary for medulloblastoma progression , advanced tumors without p53 mutations display low expression of p16 due to promoter methylation. for example , in the context of prostate cancer , pten inactivation causes senescence and leads to the acquisition of p53 mutations.. these studies , however , do not establish the sequential order of genetic events that lead to medulloblastoma formation and how these mutations correlate with presumptive histopathological stages of medulloblastoma. li fraumeni patients are cancer prone and sometimes develop medulloblastoma ; therefore , at least for this subset of patients , tp53 mutations are the first genetic event leading to medulloblastoma formation ( fig.. notably , most li fraumeni medulloblastomas belong to the shh subgroup , indicating that tp53 mutations specifically predispose to shh medulloblastoma.
