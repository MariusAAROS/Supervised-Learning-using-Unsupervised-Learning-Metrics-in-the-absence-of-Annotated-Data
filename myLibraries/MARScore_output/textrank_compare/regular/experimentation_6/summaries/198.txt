park et al found that lateral whole spine xrs with hands positioned touching the clavicle were associated with a decrease in t1 slope ( t1s ) , posterior translation of the head , hypolordotic cervical spine , and downward gazing when compared with standing lateral cervical xrs with arms relaxed on either side of the body.9 to our knowledge , no study to date has compared cervical sagittal alignment parameters obtained from standing lateral cervical xrs versus lateral whole body srs. the purpose of this study is to evaluate the correlation and reliability of cervical sagittal alignment parameters measured from lateral cervical xrs compared with lateral whole body eos srs ( eos imaging , paris , france ). cervical sagittal imbalance remains a complex problem,9 15 and optimal imaging to assess cervical sagittal alignment parameters is important during patient evaluation and particularly preoperative planning. recent advances in imaging techniques include full body sr , which allows low dose , high quality imaging of the entire spinal column and pelvis , as well as assessing for concomitant length discrepancy / deformity of the lower extremities and joints ( hips , knees , ankles).16 despite the purported advantages of sr , the difference in arm positioning compared with the standing lateral cervical xr and the effect on cervical sagittal alignment parameters is not completely understood. our findings are similar to a previous study by park et al , who evaluated cervical sagittal alignment parameters in 101 asymptomatic adults and found that lateral whole spine xrs with arms flexed in the hand touching clavicle position also resulted in posterior head translation compared with lateral cervical xrs.9 however , the study also found the arm flexed position in the whole spine xrs resulted in significantly lower t1s , cervical hypolordosis , and downward gaze. also , changes in pain or worsening deformity over time may have resulted in differences in cervical sagittal alignment parameters ; however , we attempted to reduce this confounding variable by including only patients with xr and sr images obtained less than 1 week apart. however , both arms must be forward flexed at the shoulders during sr imaging to reduce obstruction by arm overlapping the thoracic and lumbar regions , and a previous study has found arm positioning , particularly arms flexed with hands touching the clavicle , may change cervical sagittal alignment during xr imaging.
