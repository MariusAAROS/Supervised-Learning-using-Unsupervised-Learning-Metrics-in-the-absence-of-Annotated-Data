a 49year old obese male with controlled secondary glaucoma needed cataract surgery in the right eye. another approach suggested performing cataract surgery while standing , using loupes and making an inferotemporal scleral tunnel [ 5 , 6 ]. other features of kyphosis that may adversely affect intraocular surgery are tenderness and stiffness of the back and difficulty in breathing. the surgeon can still sit on the preferred temporal side of the patient and perform intraocular surgery of choice. several innovative solutions have been published , including the maximal reverse trendelenburg position and pillows under the head and neck , use of a donut and wedge shaped head positioner , allowing patients to remain in the upright sitting position while their head is positioned horizontally in a modified waiting room chair , performing surgery while standing [ 5 , 6 ] , using a 4section orthopedic operating table , or laying the patients on their sides. tilting the head end of the operating table down and raising the patient 's legs may compromise venous return from the orbit , causing venous engorgement and elevated posterior vitreous pressure during surgery. the patient could only recline to about 40 from the vertical axis despite maximal reverse trendelenburg position and a number of pillows under his back , neck , head and legs ( fig. 2 ).
