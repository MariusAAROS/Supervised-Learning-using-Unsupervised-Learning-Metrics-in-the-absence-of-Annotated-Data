in nigeria , sickle cell anaemia affects about 1 3% of the nigerian population. at the present time , there is no cure for sickle cell anaemia. the average life expectancy for people with sickle cell anaemia is less than 50 years. couple already have a 2year old child who is affected with sickle cell anaemia. cultured human pre implantation embryos have been used to develop methods which allow pgd analyses by pcr on biopsied blastomeres from an embryo.18 beta thalassaemia and sickle cell anaemia are globin chain quantitative and structural disorders that lead to anaemia syndromes. the pgd of thalassaemia and sickle cell anaemia is an alternative that avoids therapeutic abortion by diagnosing embryos for globin defects before implantation into the mother 's womb.19 on a world wide scale , pgd for thalassaemia and/or sickle cell anaemia has already been applied on single blastomeres20 and on the first and second polar bodies.21 the molecular strategies used were dna amplification followed by genetic diagnosis by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis,20 restriction enzyme digestion , the creation of a new restriction enzyme recognition sequence involving the ivs1 nt 110 mutation2122 and the use of fluorescence pcr.22 in the present study , pgd was applied clinically for sickle cell anaemia on a fertile carrier couple with previous experiences of therapeutic abortion for affected foetuses , and a sickle cell disease child. despite the fact that sickle cell anaemia is one of the most common genetic disorders and detailed genetic information is available,23 unaffected pregnancies following pgd for sickle cell anaemia previously have not been reported.
