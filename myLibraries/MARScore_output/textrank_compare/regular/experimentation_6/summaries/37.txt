, this procedure can be used to isolate bone marrow for primary cell culture of bone marrow cells , including osteoclasts and osteoblasts ( figure 2a b ). similarly , a standardized bone marrow isolation method with high bone marrow cell recovery and low inter user variability is important for experimental analysis such as fluorescence activated cell sorting ( facs ) or quantitative pcr ( qpcr ) as well as downstream applications such as primary cell culture of bone marrow cells. to isolate bone marrow , proceed to section 2. to isolate bone marrow , proceed to section 2. this method maintains the high structural and cellular integrity of the bones and bone marrow and has low handling time , minimizing the likelihood of user induced fracture or bone scoring that may influence downstream analyses. in addition , the centrifugation method for isolating bone marrow does not require cutting the bone to expose the bone marrow space or fluid to flush the bone marrow , reducing potential points of contamination. bone and bone marrow are affected in many disorders , often leading to bone marrow dysfunction , severe bone pain , and pathologic fracture.
