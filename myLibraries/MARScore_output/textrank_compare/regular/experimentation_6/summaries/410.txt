likewise , in an 18month behavioral weight loss intervention , overweight participants who reported physical activity variety ( i.e. , 2 different activities ) at 6 months had higher self reported activity related energy expenditure and a lower body mass index ( bmi ) at 18 months than those who did not report physical activity variety ( i.e. , only 1 activity ). thus , while the above findings suggest that physical activity variety may contribute to higher physical activity levels within the context of behavioral weight loss treatment , it is unclear whether physical activity variety is associated with higher physical activity in individuals who have achieved long term success in controlling their body weight. in the current study , we examined the relationship between physical activity variety , defined as the number of different types of self reported moderate to vigorous activities performed in one week , and minutes spent in objectively measured moderate to vigorous physical activity ( mvpa ) in two groups of individuals who have successfully maintained their body weight long term : ( 1 ) weight loss maintainers with previous history of overweight / obesity and ( 2 ) normal weight individuals without a history of overweight. it is possible that the association between physical activity variety and mvpa could be different for weight loss maintainers and normal weight individuals. however , based on previous research showing a relationship between physical activity variety and higher physical activity levels across diverse groups and settings [ 14 , 15 ] , we predicted that engagement in a greater variety of moderate to vigorous activities would be associated with higher mvpa daily minutes in both the weight loss maintainer and normal weight groups. linear regression was used to examine the associations of physical activity variety and group status ( weight loss maintainers versus normal weight ) with objectively measured mvpa minutes / day , adjusting for age , gender , years of education , marital status , bmi , and accelerometer daily wear time. logistic regression was used to assess whether physical activity variety and group status were associated with achieving the 250 mvpa minutes / week recommendation for optimal long term weight maintenance.
