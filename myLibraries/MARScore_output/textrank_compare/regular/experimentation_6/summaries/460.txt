amc isolates , susceptibility to other antimicrobial drugs , including ciprofloxacin , gentamicin , cefotaxime , and cotrimoxazole , was more frequent in community ( 28.7% ) than in hospital acquired isolates ( 13.3% ; or 1.68 , 95% ci 1.272.22 ; p = 0.0003 ). there were 3,384 ( 37.9% ) isolates implicated in hospital acquired infections and 5,540 ( 62.1% ) in community acquired infections ; information was missing for 166 cases. this increase was due to community acquired e. coli isolates only ; the nonsusceptible proportion varied from 11.5% ( 2005 ) to 15.6% ( 2006 ) ( or 1.42 , 95% ci 1.161.74 ; p = 0.0009 ) in community acquired isolates compared with 15.4% ( 2005 ) to 15.2% ( 2006 ) in hospital acquired isolates ( figure 1 ). when esbl producing e. coli isolates were excluded from analysis , amc nonsusceptibility increased from 8.4% ( 2003 ) to 14.3% ( 2006 ) ( test for trend 34.39 ; p<0.0001 ) in total isolates ; from 8.2% ( 2003 ) to 14.5% ( 2006 ) ( test or trend 25.23 ; p<0.0001 ) in community acquired isolates ; and from 8.9% ( 2003 ) to 13.3% ( 2006 ) ( test for trend 6.35 ; p = 0.012 ) in hospital acquired isolates ( figure 1 ). hospital acquired infections were defined as infections acquired at least 48 hours after hospital admission. the 42 participating spanish hospitals were selected according to earss criteria ( 1,7 ). the total catchment population was 9 million people , or 22.5% of the spanish population.
