enhanced tspo expression can be detected in vivo by using positron emission tomography ( pet ) imaging with the selective tspo radioligand c pk11195 ( benavides et al. , 1993 ; banati et al. , 1999 ) , with evidence that increases in c pk11195 binding potential ( bpnd ) correspond to activation of microglia ( stephenson et al. , 1995 ; conway et al. therefore , in the absence of invading blood borne cells or severe focal leakage of blood brain barrier , the increased pk11195 binding is likely to indicate the transition of microglia from a resting to an activated state , and is due to an increase in the number , rather than the affinity , of tspo ( banati et al. , 2000 ). it has also been demonstrated that there is increased c pk11195 bpnd in areas of focal pathology identified by t1 and t2weighted mri ( vowinckel et al. , 1997 ; banati et al. , 2000 ) and in gadolinium enhanced t1weighted mri ( debruyne et al. , 2003 ). however , it seems that the plasticity of microglia must be considered with regards to their contribution in pd , and their role ; whether beneficial or detrimental , it may depend on the stimuli present and the stage of disease ( li et al. , 2007 ; michelucci et al. , 2009 ; sanchez guajardo et al. ,. c pk11195 has been used to demonstrate increased levels of activated microglia in both ad animal models ( venneti et al. , 2009 ) and ad patients ( cagnin et al. , 2001 ; edison et al. , 2008 ; yokokura et al. , 2011 ). nashat et al. tspo are found in abundance throughout the body in peripheral organs ( i.e. , liver and adrenals ) , and hematogenous cells , but are present at very low levels in the normal healthy cns ( banati , 2002 ). microglia account for approximately 10% of the adult brain cell population and represent the first and main form of immune defense in the central nervous system ( cns ;
