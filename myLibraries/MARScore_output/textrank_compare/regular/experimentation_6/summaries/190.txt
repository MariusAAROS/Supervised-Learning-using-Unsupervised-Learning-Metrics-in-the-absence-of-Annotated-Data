the bacteria were inactivated equally by all qacs , although in the absence of interfering substances ctab was the most efficient solution. in fact , disinfectants can be seriously affected by the presence of organic matter.. interfering substances have been studied in the last years and included in cleaning and disinfection plans regulated by the authorities such as the european standard en1276. the antimicrobial activity of the qacs against the bacterial consortium ( figure 3 ) was affected by the presence of interfering substances. this effect is probably due to the low concentration of interfering substances tested that caused both respiratory activity reduction and potentiation. this is valid mainly when the qacs were applied in the absence of interfering substances. however , the linear dependency of inactivation versus concentration is not verified for most of the tests where interfering substances were added. this result evidences that the mathematical modelling of disinfection strategies requires a case to case analysis when interfering substances are present.
