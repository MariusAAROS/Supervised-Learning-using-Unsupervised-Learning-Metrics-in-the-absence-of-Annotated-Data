3radiograph at 32 months depicting union garden 4 type fracture of the neck of the femur showing persistent non union at 2 years radiograph at 32 months depicting union anatomical reduction and rigid internal fixation are the two important surgeon controlled factors that may contribute to outcome. displaced fractures in healthy , active patients are best treated by reduction and internal fixation. if failure is due to technical errors , revision open reduction and internal fixation may be adequate. revision internal fixation with cancellous or muscle pedicle bone grafting ( vascularised bone graft ) or an osteotomy results in useful outcome. the femoral head often leads to healing complications , while the more predictable prosthetic replacements are associated with poorer function and significant complications. the treatment of these fractures depends on the age of the patient , fracture displacement , bone quality , timing of surgery and activity level of the patient. there are however , complications unique to femoral neck fractures which are almost impossible to predict.
