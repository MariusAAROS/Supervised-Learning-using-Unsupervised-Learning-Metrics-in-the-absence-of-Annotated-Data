the higher frequency of each type of accident in adhd patients was compared to healthy subjects ( odds ratio 1.7 ) and the car accidents are a subgroup of these events ( 20 ). on the other hand , it is shown that high risk behaviors of adhd patients during driving would persist despite controlling other factors. on the other hand , it has previously been shown that the mortality or major injuries and severity of injury in adhd patients experiencing car accidents is more than healthy subjects ( 26 , 27 ). accordingly , the percent of subjects with accident history was significantly higher in case group ( p= 0.24 ). furthermore , the mean driving hours in case group was significantly more compared to controls. in this study , the frequency of adult adhd was compared between traumatic adult patients ( due to traffic injuries ) and a control group. sobanski et al. , evaluated 27 patients with adult adhd and 27 age and sex matched subjects as a control group.
