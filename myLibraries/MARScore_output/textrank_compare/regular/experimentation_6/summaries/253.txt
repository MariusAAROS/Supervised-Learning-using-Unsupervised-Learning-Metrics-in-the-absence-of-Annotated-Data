the simplicity , rapidity , and inexpensiveness of the proposed method in combination with the use of dithizone as a chromogenic reagent were utilized for selenium determination in cosmetic and pharmaceutical samples. the relative standard deviation was 2.18% for six replicate measurements of standard selenium solution ( 50 ng ml ).. selenium metal ( purity : 99.9% ) was obtained from the riedel de haen ( germany ). the stock standard solution of selenium ( iv ) ( 1000 g ml ) was prepared by dissolving 100 mg of selenium metal in hot concentrated nitric acid and diluted to 100 ml with water. selenium ( iv ) reacts with dithizone ( hdz ) in micellar medium and forms a hydrophobic complex , se(hdz)4 , which is subsequently trapped in the surfactant micelles and separated from the aqueous phase.. figure 2 shows the absorption spectra for the dithizone and selenium dithizonate complex in surfactant rich phase against a reagent blank. selenium ( se ) has been recognized as an essential nutrient for plant , animal , and human body , but at high concentration it can become toxic. the range between the concentration in which selenium is essential and toxic is very narrow [ 1 , 2 ].
