additionally , larger lesions reduced faster that smaller ones , and kcots showed more positive results for decompression than other lesion types.(table 2 ) one patient 's recovery was complicated by hypoesthesia after marsupialization , but this naturally recovered over time. according to this study , all patients treated with decompression were reported to have shown a reduction in lesion size and higher sensitivity with a larger lesion size. enucleation generally induces bone regeneration within a cystic lesion less than 3 cm in diameter and eliminates the lesion ; however , it is difficult to postoperatively predict lesion recurrence and bone regeneration in cases of larger cysts. for this reason. , a surgeon can choose between conservative and aggressive treatments for a large , aggressive , cystic tumor12. it has been reported that marsupialization and decompression , both of which are conservative treatments that create an opening to reduce pressure within a cystic cavity and induce bone formation , generate few postoperative complications and produce great therapeutic effects3456. these procedures not only provide good surgical access to smaller lesions , but they also preserve intraoral tissues , maintain pulp vitality , and reduce recurrence rates.
