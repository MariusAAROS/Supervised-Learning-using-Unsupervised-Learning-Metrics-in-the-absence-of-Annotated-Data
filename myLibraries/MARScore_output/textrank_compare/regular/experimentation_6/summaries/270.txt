the underlying etiologies of ppi in patients were : radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer in 13 patients ( open radical retropubic prostatectomy=12 , transperitoneal laparoscopic radical prostatectomy=1 ) , open prostatectomy in 5 patients and transurethral prostate resection for bph in 3 patients. , patients were questioned regarding their daily pad use. the authors claimed that the invance sling offers a good intermediate cure and improvement rates with acceptably low rate of complications in patients suffering from ppi. patients with stress urinary incontinence due to radical retropubic prostatectomy ( n=32 ) , robot assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy ( n=3 ) and transurethral prostate resection ( n=5 ) underwent the bas procedure over a 5 years period. although complications occurred in this study , including the removal of the device and the removal of inflation component due to local scrotal infection , our intermediate follow up study suggests that an adjustable perineal male sling using a tissue expander appears to be an efficient and safe alternative surgical treatment option for patients suffering from ppi. the major limitations of our study were the small number of patients and the duration of the follow up period. additional follow up and larger series of patients are necessary to confirm our results.
