cervical cancer develops in a multi stage process , successively passing from a cervix with a normal epithelium to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and finally leading to invasive cervical cancer. in a recent study , pinx1 was displayed as a novel target gene of p53 , proposing the suppression of p53/pinx1 pathway as a novel mechanism to enhance the telomerase activity in cervical cancer cells , and leading to reduction of cell proliferation. p53 could promote the convergence of the apoptotic and angiogenic pathways in cervical cancer cells. many recent investigations have shown that sirna can efficiently inhibit oncogene expression in cancer cells. cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide and accounted for 7.6 million cases ( 13% of all deaths ) in 2008 ; in 2013 in the united states there are 12,340 estimated new cases and 4,030 deaths by cervical cancer [ american cancer society : cancer facts and figures 2013 ]. meanwhile in romania , based on statistical data from 2012 , cervical cancer is ranked third place taking in account the women cancer incidence , after the breast and colorectal cancer. consequently , considerable importance has been given to the molecular premise which leads to the progression of cervical cancer.
