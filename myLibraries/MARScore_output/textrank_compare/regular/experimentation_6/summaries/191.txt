the present study extends previous work by empirically addressing the extent to which politically oriented coping activities engaged in as a response to a macrolevel social stressor , the great recession , are protective against alcohol related outcomes compared with coping strategies focused outside of the political realm. there is consistent evidence that women are more likely to use support based coping strategies ( e.g. , seeking support from others such as partner family and friends ) in response to stress in contrast to men and some indication that avoidant coping techniques are associated with greater alcohol consumption among men but not women [ 1 , 2022 ]. on the one hand , economic strain appears to be associated with drinking more and more problematically , in the extent to which it is associated with a tendency to engage in avoidant coping strategies. as shown in figure 4 , the mediating effects of avoidant coping differ for men and women because the relationship between avoidant coping and problematic drinking is significantly less strong for women compared to men ( = 0.319 , s.e. thus , the observation that economic strain is associated with greater problematic drinking in the extent to which it is associated with avoidant coping strategies appears to be more pronounced among men than among women. respondents with less than a high school degree are found to be marginally less likely ( p < 0.10 ) to use active coping strategies compared to those with a college degree or postcollege training. this latter model assesses all of the direct and indirect paths between economic stressors and the drinking outcomes considered through the nonpolitical and politically oriented coping tactics investigated. social scientists who explore factors mediating and moderating the relationships between social stressors and mental health , including drinking outcomes , have highlighted modes of coping [ 1 , 2 ].
