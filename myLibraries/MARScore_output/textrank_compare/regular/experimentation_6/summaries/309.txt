attempts were made to pass a guidewire beyond the obstruction up into the chd and intrahepatic ducts but without success. it was not possible to retroflex the choledochoscope to examine the common hepatic or intrahepatic ducts. it is generally accepted that an increased risk of bile duct injury exists during surgery for ms , and laparoscopic surgery may increase this risk. acute mirizzi syndrome should be suspected when a patient presents with acute cholecystitis and jaundice with dilated intrahepatic ducts on ultrasound. the classical ultrasound findings are of a contracted gallbladder , dilated intrahepatic ducts , and a normal common bile duct ( cbd ). this showed dilated intrahepatic ducts with the cbd reported as also being dilated and measuring 9 mm in diameter. a stent was left through the papilla , below the obstruction and this allowed primary duct closure during surgery.
