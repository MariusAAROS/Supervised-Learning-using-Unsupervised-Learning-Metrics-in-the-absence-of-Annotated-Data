a comparison between slkt recipients with hepatitis b infection and lt recipients with renal insufficiency and hepatitis b infection could provide a more objective assessment of the outcome of slkt associated with hepatitis b. in addition , which indicators can predict the long term outcomes of liver transplant patients still need to be assessed. this study reported the largest number of hepatitis b patients receiving slkt , in which the 1 , 3 , and 5year survival rates were 90.5% , 81.0% , and 81.0% , respectively. however , in asian countries , including china , most liver transplant recipients are hepatitis b virus carriers , in whom the outcome of slkt is less understood. slkt recipients received a triple maintenance therapy of calcineurin inhibitor ( cni ; cyclosporine and tacrolimus ) , mycophenolate mofetil ( mmf ) and prednisolone ( pred ) , while lt recipients received the steroid free regimen of cni + mmf. slkt recipients received a triple maintenance therapy of calcineurin inhibitor ( cni ; cyclosporine and tacrolimus ) , mycophenolate mofetil ( mmf ) and prednisolone ( pred ) , while lt recipients received the steroid free regimen of cni + mmf. meld scores , child pugh scores , and incidence of preoperative dialysis were not significantly different between slkt and lt recipients. however , slkt recipients had lower egfr ( p=0.003 ) and higher preoperative serum creatinine levels ( p=0.004 ) , lower serum ast levels , and lower total serum bilirubin levels than lt recipients ( table 2 ).
