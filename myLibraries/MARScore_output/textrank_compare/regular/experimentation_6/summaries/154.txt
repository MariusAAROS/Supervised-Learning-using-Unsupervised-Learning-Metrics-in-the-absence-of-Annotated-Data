through the use of all the available p2y12immunoreactive antibodies recognizing the c terminus or the second intracellular loop of the receptor , the aim of the present work is to provide comparative evidence about p2y12 cell specificity in microglia versus oligodendrocytes particularly from the healthy and diseased cns under neuroinflammatory conditions as those sustained during amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( als ) and multiple sclerosis ( ms ). moreover , we confirm a decrease of p2y12 receptor signal in proximity to the demyelinating lesion , as detected by loss of mbp positive fibers ( see asterisks ). in order to establish cell specificity of p2y12 receptor expression. ( figures 3 and 4 ) , a similar pattern of p2y12 receptor expression is shown in human frontal cortex autoptic tissue by using c ter antibody that highlights only microglia uniformly distributed throughout the entire healthy tissue ( red ) , but not mbp positive myelinated structures ( green ) , as detected by the absence of overlapping immunofluorescent signals ( figures 5(a ) , 5(b ) , and 5(c ) , merged and insets a1 , c1 ). ( sigma aldrich ) , in combination with primary antibodies against p2y12 receptor , as reported in table 1. p2y12 receptor is formed by two transcript variants that give rise to identical proteins with 342 amino acids , a secondary structure constituted by seven hydrophobic transmembrane domains connected by three extracellular and three intracellular loops , with four extracellular cysteine residues most likely contributing to the nucleotide binding site ( figure 1(a ) ). in order to validate the use of these different antibodies for p2y12 receptor , we compared them on recombinant p2y12 receptor protein obtained by cloning the complete cdna of the human receptor into the eukaryotic expression vector cs2 + mt , to provide the expression of a n terminal c myc tagged fusion protein.
