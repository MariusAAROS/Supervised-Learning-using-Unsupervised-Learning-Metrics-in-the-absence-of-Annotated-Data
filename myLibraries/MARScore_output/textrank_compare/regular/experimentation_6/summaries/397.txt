these papers once again summarize the available evidence in hf management in african americans and call for more therapeutic trial focused in these high risk population.. the african american heart failure trial ( a heft ) was the first heart failure large trial to focus specifically on the african american population and evidence represented approximately 50% of all african americans ever studied in heart failure trials.. other genetic polymorphisms in african americans that may influence heart failure risk include elevated production of endothelial nitric oxide synthase , aldosterone synthase , and the g protein 825t allele. evidence shows that less than half of patients with heart failure survive five years ( after diagnosis ) , and less than a quarter of them live ten years after their initial diagnosis. framingham heart study showed that hypertensive patients were more likely to develop heart failure ( 142 cases of hf detected during the first 16 years of followup ) than those who were normotensive. african americans who are homozygous for polymorphisms in both the 1adrenergic and a2c adrenergic receptor genes are at a 10fold greater risk for heart failure , which is overexpressed in african americans.. groups with overexpression of transforming growth factor 1 ( tgf1 ) , a cytokine involved in cardiac fibrosis and remodeling , vascular and renal disease , production of the vasoconstrictor , endothelin1 , and stimulation of renin release , have a worse prognosis. several large , randomized clinical trials have shown that specific classes of medication have mortality benefit in patients with heart failure [ 2834 ]. furthermore , genomic evidence from the grahf ( genetic risk assessment of heart failure in african americans ) arm of the african american heart failure trial ( a heft ) showed that blacks with the more common tt phenotype ( 61% ) of the aldosterone synthase gene ( cyp11b2 ) showed greater responsiveness to the combination of isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine.
