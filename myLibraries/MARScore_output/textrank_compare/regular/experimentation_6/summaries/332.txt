the incidence of venous co2 embolism of any size is 17.1% , whereas the incidence of massive gas emboli is only 0.5%. in contrast , there have been reports of co2 embolism , pneumothorax , subcutaneous emphysema , and hypercarbia. the reported incidence rate of co2 embolism ranges from 1 200 cases in every one million laparoscopic surgeries. a nitroglycerine drip was started to lower pulmonary artery pressure , and phenylephrine boluses were administered to maintain systemic blood pressure within an acceptable range. we noted the patient 's etco2 had returned back to 35 mmhg , pulmonary artery pressure had decreased steadily back to a baseline level of 40/20 mmhg , and continued down to 30/18 mmhg , whereas systemic blood pressure stabilized at 100/60 mmhg without vasopressor support. approximately 20 minutes after endoscopic vein harvesting started , we noticed the patient 's end tidal co2 ( etco2 ) had increased from 36 to 44 mmhg followed by increasing pulmonary artery pressure from 42/20 to 60/39 mmhg within 1 minute. a 55year old caucasian female was undergoing elective coronary artery bypass surgery following a recent myocardial infarction.
