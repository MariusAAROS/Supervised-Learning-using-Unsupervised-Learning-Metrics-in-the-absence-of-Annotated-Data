although the cytocompatibility of a biomaterial is strongly influenced by its chemical composition , surface topography plays a crucial role for cell surface interactions. some data have shown proinflammatory effects of different biomaterials which increase with the degree of surface roughness. starting with photolithography and dry etching in the 1980 's to high resolution electron beam lithography and other technologies in the 1990 's. , nanotechnology allows for making surface structures for cell engineering and has led to an increasing application in healthcare over the last decades. because many variables influence cellular interactions to surface structures , it is difficult to draw conclusions and formulate general principles for nano and microstructured surfaces. the following review gives an overview of cellular reactions to surface structures of different orthopaedic biomaterials. another example of the significance of surface structures for protein binding and osteoblast attachment is the helical rosette nanotubes ( hrn ) which can build self assembly surface structures. here , information about typical parameters such as chemical composition , surface structure ( topography , geometry , roughness , particle size ) , surface energy , hydrophobicity , and the degree of solubility in aqueous solutions of a biomaterial will help to value and grade a defined implant concerning its osteblast promoting potency.
