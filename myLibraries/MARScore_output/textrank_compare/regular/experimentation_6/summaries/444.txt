from the direct birth related costs , antenatal care accounted for approximately r$233 million ( 5.7% ) of birth costs , with labor and delivery costs responsible for r$988 million ( 24.3% ). the remainder of birth costs were attributed to infant complications , estimated to be r$2.8 billion ( 70.0% ) , with neonatal costs accountable for approximately r$628 million ( 15.4% ) and hospital readmission in the first year costs of r$2.1 billion ( 52.9% ) of all birth costs annually. the public health costs attributed to unintended births in a single year cost taxpayers $ 11.1 billion ( 2006).6 furthermore , previous studies have reported that ups are more likely to result in preterm births and low birth weight babies , which would increase health costs for neonatal care and costs associated with long term disabilities.7 this is particularly relevant for ups in adolescence , which are more likely to result in low birth weight births , which can increase health costs.8 over the past few decades , brazil , like many fast emerging economies , has experienced a fertility transition noted by a dramatic reduction in the total fertility rate , which currently sits at 1.8 births per woman.9,10 furthermore , during the fertility transition , the rate of contraception has also increased.11 despite increased contraception use , the cumulative rate of spontaneous and induced abortion changed very little between 1996 and 2006 , for which population survey estimates are available.12,13 furthermore , a survey of more than 1,000 women aged 1024 years in a single postnatal unit in brazil reported that more than 50% of all births were unintended , suggesting that possibly significant unmet contraception need still exists.8 similarly , for the whole country , the data from the last demographic and health survey ( dhs ) performed in 2006 indicates that 55% of all births were unintended.14 prevention of up using publicly funded programs in high income countries has proven to generate significant cost savings for health services and public services.15 previous economic studies evaluating the consequences of up have mostly been performed in high income countries where publicly funded fertility services and abortion legislation are different from those in low/middle income countries.15 the aim of this study was to evaluate the cost consequences of up in brazil , an emerging economy with vastly different fertility planning services than most advanced economies and with restrictive abortion laws. additionally , the long term societal costs that arise from up and reduced educational attainment and lost productivity of young mothers has not been accounted for in our analysis.3639 our analysis highlights that considerable cost savings can be achieved by reducing up , which are thought to represent 55% of all pregnancies in brazil.20 the analysis accounted for both untimed and unwanted births to estimate the up rate and associated costs , in which live births resulting from unwanted pregnancies represented the largest share of health costs , representing 99% of all costs. the cost per up factors in a range of health related costs attributed to those resulting in abortion and resulting live births for those carried to parturition. however , it is recognized worldwide that direct health costs of up and resulting abortions can significantly impact local health services and the families affected.5 health system and societal costs can also arise from ups that do not end in abortion and are carried to parturition. the construct of unintended pregnancies ( ups ) is multifactorial and broadly encompasses pregnancies that are either unwanted or mistimed.1 in many instances , ups are likely to end by induced abortion ; worldwide estimates suggest that 50% will be voluntarily terminated.2 in 2008 , it was estimated that 43.8 million abortions occurred worldwide , of which 86% occurred in low/middle income countries.3 furthermore , between 2003 and 2008 , the number of induced abortions was found to have decreased in high income countries but to have increased in low/middle income countries.
