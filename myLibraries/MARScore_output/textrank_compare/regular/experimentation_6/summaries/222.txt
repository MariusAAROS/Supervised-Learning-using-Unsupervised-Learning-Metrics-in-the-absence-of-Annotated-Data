indeed , some reports in the literature indicate the usefulness of the cox2 inhibitors in the treatment of indomethacin responsive headaches [ 38 ]. all of them have absolutely response to indomethacin , but the presence of adverse reactions or intolerability let us discontinued and introduce celecoxib with completely recovery of the symptoms.table 1clinical characteristics of the patientscaseagegenderheadache typesidedoses ( mg)time in month142fhpleft20012256mhcleft40010378fhcleft40018464fhcright40010576mhcleft4006all doses correspond to celecoxibf female , m male , hc hemicrania continua , hp hemicrania paroxistica clinical characteristics of the patients all doses correspond to celecoxib f female , m male , hc hemicrania continua , hp hemicrania paroxistica indomethacin is consider the first choice drug for the treatment of indomethacin responsive headaches , and the headache resolution is consider as a diagnosis criteria in some of theses headaches. celecoxib have been previously reported to be effective in the treatment of other indomethacin responsive headache [ 311 ] , however , there was no absolutely response in all patients. we present five patients suffering indomethacin responsive headache case 1 suffering from paroxysmal hemicranias and cases from 2 to 5 from hemicranias continua ( table 1 ). the pathophysiology of theses indomethacin response headache are still unknown , but the cyclo oxygenase ( cox)2 should be implicated in the pathogenesis. although indomethacin is usually well tolerated , some patients developed gastrointestinal side effects , specially those patients who require long term therapy.. therefore , the use of cyclo oxygenase2 specific inhibitors could reduce secondary effects and they are essentially equipotent to indomethacin in vitro and in vivo.
