for each technical repeat , we calculated correlation values for raw and normalized log2 intensities and we included in the calculation only probes with p value of < 0.01. for each technical repeat , we calculated correlation values for raw and normalized log2 intensities and we included in the calculation only probes with p value of < 0.01. in order to decide whether intensity data was significantly above background , p values. were calculated to test the null hypothesis that expression is absent ( called p value detected ). lastly , we also calculated p values for determining whether genes were differentially expressed. in order to decide whether intensity data was significantly above background , p values. were calculated to test the null hypothesis that expression is absent ( called p value detected ).
