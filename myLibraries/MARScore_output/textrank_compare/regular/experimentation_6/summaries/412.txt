although there is a relative paucity of relevant studies in the literature , previous studies have demonstrated that children with cognitive delay seem to derive benefit from ci , albeit at a slower rate than nondelayed children [ 22 , 23 ]. previous studies suggest that children with symptomatic cmv derive auditory benefit from cis , albeit at a slower rate than other children. the variability of neurocognitive deficits in these children warrants the examination of this group separately from other children with developmental disabilities. given the relatively large number of children potentially affected by cmv related hearing loss and the wide range of manifestations of congenital cmv infection , it is difficult to predict how a child with symptomatic cmv will perform with a cochlear implant ( ci ). the objective of our study was to examine the relationships between intracranial radiographic abnormalities and preimplantation developmental assessment ( including head circumference ) with postimplant audiometric and language outcomes in children with symptomatic congenital cmv who have undergone cochlear implantation. this study was a retrospective review of children with a diagnosis of symptomatic congenital cmv who underwent cochlear implantation between 2004 and 2010 at a tertiary pediatric cochlear implant center. these evaluations were completed by psychologists with knowledge of testing deaf / hard of hearing children.
