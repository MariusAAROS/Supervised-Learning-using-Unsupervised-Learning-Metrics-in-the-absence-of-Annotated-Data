the correspondence analysis also showed the association between microleakage and both types of apical gaps ( figure 3 ). this study has shown that the presence of apical gaps at the sealer / dentin or sealer / cone interfaces had an effect on apical microleakage. the association of gutta percha cones and root canal sealer has been traditionally used for this purpose. etch and rinse adhesives have been tested with resin cements and the combination of a dentin bonding agent and an epoxy resin based root canal sealer significantly reduced apical leakage. nevertheless , other researches pointed out that the epiphany system provided the greatest resistance to the movement of fluids or dye leakage test , when compared to epoxy resin based root canal sealers , but others have just indicated the opposite. stress generated during the polymerization shrinkage of epiphany sealer has probably influenced the integrity loss at the sealer / dentin interface. it is generally accepted that microleakage between the filling materials and root canal walls might adversely affect the outcome of root canal treatment.
