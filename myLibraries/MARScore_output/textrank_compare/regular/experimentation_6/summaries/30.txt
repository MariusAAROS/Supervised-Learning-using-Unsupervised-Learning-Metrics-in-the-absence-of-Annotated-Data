in the outpatient setting , endometrial sampling is an effective and acceptable method for obtaining endometrial samples for histopathological assessment [ 3 , 4 ]. dilatation and curettage ( d&c ) has been widely considered to be the method of choice for obtaining endometrial samples for histopathological evaluation.. inadequate sampling is more problematic in postmenopausal women , for whom up to 68% of endometrial samples are reported to be inadequate. the purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of the explora model i tool with the conventional d&c technique for obtaining adequate endometrial samples that are capable of providing specific and informative histopathologic diagnoses. this retrospective study suggests that traditional d&c produces better endometrial sample adequacy than the explora technique. the majority of women with menorrhagia , postcoital bleeding , intermenstrual bleeding , or postmenopausal bleeding ultimately undergo diagnostic hysteroscopy with endometrial sampling as part of their assessment , particularly if symptoms persist or pelvic imaging suggests a uterine abnormality. endometrial sampling for the evaluation of dysfunctional uterine bleeding and the diagnosis of endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma and other indications remains one of the most commonly performed gynecological procedures [ 14 ].
