binmoeller et al. have reported the feasibility and safety of the front view forward array echoendoscope for evaluating right colon lesions. [ figure 2 ]. examination of the fna specimen revealed a foreign body ( string of gauze ) displaying macrophage cells and necrotic tissue [ figure 3 ; hematoxylin and eosin , original magnification 40 ]. histological examination of the tissue adjacent to the foreign body revealed granuloma formations with fragmented silken threads [ figure 4 ; hematoxylin and eosin , original magnification , 100 and 200 ]. gossypiboma causes foreign body reactions of the surrounding tissue since they are inert and show no specific decomposition. endoscopic ultrasound ( eus)fine needle aspiration using forward view eus a foreign body ( string of gauze ) obtained using the 22gauge needle , with macrophage cells and necrotic tissue granuloma formations with fragmented silken threads. gossypiboma ( retained surgical sponge ) describes a mass of cotton or sponge that is left behind in the body cavity during a surgical operation. these foreign bodies can often mimic tumors or abscesses when detected clinically or with radiation.
