the differential diagnosis of dysphagia aortica includes various common structural and neuromuscular abnormalities.1 ) gastroesophageal reflux disease and motility disorders are common causes of dysphagia. dysphagia aortica is an uncommon type of dysphagia that is caused by extrinsic mechanical compression. it should be differentiated from other causes of dysphagia , such as gastroesophageal reflux disease or motility disorders , because dysphagia aortica often requires surgical intervention that can significantly reduce the morbidity and these interventions can be curative in some situations. dysphagia can be classified into an oropharyngeal or an esophageal location , and it is caused by neuromuscular motility disorders and mechanical obstruction.1 ) mechanical dysphagia is associated with intrinsic or extrinsic compression , resulting in progressive intolerance to solids. the term , dysphagia aortica , has been used to describe difficulty in swallowing caused by external compression from an ectatic , tortuous , or aneurysmal aorta as a result of age related degeneration.2 ) dysphagia aortica is classically seen in elderly women with short stature who have hypertension and kyphosis.3 ) we concluded that the symptoms and the results of the imaging studies were consistent with dysphagia aortica. then , the esophagus lies on the left side of the aorta and penetrates the diaphragm through the diaphragmatic histus.4 ) the aging process and the accompanying degenerative changes with the loss of elasticity causes a dilated , elongated , and distorted aorta , which may result in a so called reverse c or reverse s shaped aorta.3 ) as a result , the esophagus is pushed and compressed by the aorta against the cardiac chambers , which are anterior in location.5 ) there is no gold standard diagnostic procedure for dysphagia aortica.
