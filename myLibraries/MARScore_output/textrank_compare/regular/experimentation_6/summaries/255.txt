the triad of soft tissue lesions , osteomas , and dental abnormalities in fap patients has therefore been named gardner syndrome.3 4 gardner fibromas ( gf ) have been defined only recently as superficial and poorly circumscribed tumor like lesions , which consist mainly of thick haphazardly arranged collagen bundles with few interspersed spindle cells of fibroblast type.5 6 7 gf are regarded as a precursor lesion of desmoid tumors which have a more cellular appearance. mri scan 16 weeks after birth tumor size : 8 5 cm. mri scan 16 weeks after birth tumor size : 8 5 cm. the loss of the wildtype allele of apc in the tumor has been shown to be a relatively frequent event in desmoid tumors in adult fap individuals.13 unfortunately , these data are not available in our patients.. it has been stated that approximately 5 to 10% appear to resolve spontaneously , 30% undergo cycles of progression and resolution , 50% remain stable after diagnosis , but 10% tend to progress rapidly , growing to massive sizes and infiltrating adjacent tissue.4 it is also known that there is a relationship between frequency of extracolonic manifestations and the position of apc germline mutations in patients with fap.4 14 15 for example , the risk of developing desmoid tumors is increased in patients with an apc mutation 3 to codon 1399,16 and reaches up to 100% in patients with a mutation in codons 1395 to 1493.17 studies correlating the risk of developing gf with a particular genotype are not available. it may be discussed if site and type of apc mutations may play a role in disease outcome , since patient a carries a large deletion encompassing most of the apc coding region , whereas patient b has an underlying mutation in the desmoid region of the apc gene.4 screening for somatic apc mutations in the tumor indicating loss of heterozygosity might have been instructive. familial adenomatous polyposis ( fap ) is a rare cause of colorectal cancer and is caused by a wide spectrum of mutations in the apc gene.1 2 fap usually presents with a 100 to 1,000 of precancerous colonic polyps.
