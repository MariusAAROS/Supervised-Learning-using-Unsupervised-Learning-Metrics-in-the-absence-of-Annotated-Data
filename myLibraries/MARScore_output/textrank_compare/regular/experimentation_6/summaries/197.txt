in the present case , we performed thrombolytic therapy with angiographic evaluation of blood flow , sequentially and intermittently , after exploratory laparotomy , which enabled us not only to accurately evaluate intestinal blood flow or viability , but also to avoid a second look operation. from 1985 to 2007 , 45 cases of thrombolytic therapy for acute sma occlusion were reported in japan. careful monitoring during 24 h after the completion of thrombolytic therapy is essential , and emergency laparotomy is mandatory if intestinal necrosis is suspected. intestinal blood flow was well visualized on ct angiography performed 48 h after laparotomy ( 60 h after the first thrombolytic therapy ). on the other hand , when no apparent intestinal necrosis is observed during exploratory laparotomy , a clinical consensus concerning the indication of additional thrombolytic therapy or optimal methods for evaluation of intestinal blood flow or viability in the subsequent follow up is not yet established. in particular , it is much less invasive than strategies described in previous reports and enables accurate evaluation of intestinal blood flow or viability over the time course. recent reports indicate that selective thrombolytic therapy with intraarterial infusion of urokinase is effective for acute sma occlusion diagnosed early after onset.
