transthoracic echocardiography , transesophageal echocardiography , and finally cardiac catheterization revealed ejection fraction of 5055% , pulmonary hypertension with pulmonary artery pressure ( pap ) of 80/40 mm hg , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 23 mm hg , gradient in the mitral valve plane of 40 mm hg , no residual vsd , no patent ductus arteriosus ( pda ) , bicuspid aortic valve , no aortic insufficiency , no aortic stenosis , no sub aortic web , normal coronary arteries , mild mitral regurgitation , moderate to severe mitral stenosis , supra mitral valve ring , normal left ventricle size , moderate right ventricle enlargement , and moderate systolic dysfunction. shone s complex is a combination of four congenital heart defects : supravalvar mitral ring , parachute mitral valve , subvalvar aortic stenosis , and aortic coarctation. about 15 years ago , he had undergone a cardiac operation for ventricular septal defect ( vsd ) closure and mitral valve repair. adhesion to the valve may impair the opening of the leaflets , and this impairment may be the main mechanism of mitral valve inflow obstruction in some patients. supravalvar mitral ring is a circumferential ridge or membrane arising from the left atrial wall overlying the mitral valve and frequently attached to the mitral valve.1 variable in thickness and extent , the ring ranges from a thin membrane to a thick discrete fibrous ridge.2 the membranous variety may be difficult to detect because the membrane often adheres to the anterior mitral valve leaflet while remaining just proximal to the posterior mitral leaflet. in other patients , the ring may be large enough to protrude into the mitral valve inflow and cause obstruction. the supramitral ring may initially be incomplete and eccentric , allowing for an unobstructed flow through the mitral valve.
