, there are scarce data regarding the changes in is in t2d with ischemic stroke subtypes. however , detailed mechanisms of the possible link between the presence of ischemic stroke subtypes and insulin resistance remain to be clarified. it was previously suggested that atherothrombotic infarction ( ati ) and lacunar infarction ( li ) , as two different subtypes of ischemic stroke , might also differ in the set of the relevant risk factors , with ati being more associated to the atherogenic risk factors in contrast to li.. simultaneously , it has been shown that impaired balance between products of oxidative stress and the level of antioxidant enzyme activities might be the important mechanism underlying the occurrence of ischemic stroke. until now , experimental studies provided evidence of an association between ischemic stroke and increased oxidative stress [ 8 , 9 ] , but data in humans are still heterogeneous and limited. in this study we included a total of 93 patients with t2d , ascribed to the following groups : t2d patients with ati ( group a , n = 30 ) , and t2d with li ( group b , n = 30 ) , and t2d without ischemic stroke ( group c , n = 33 ). diagnosis of ati and li was done by a neurologist due to clinical features and brain imaging methods such as cranial computerized scan and/or magnetic resonance imaging in two consecutive examinations , during the first 7 days from the appearance of ischemic stroke.
