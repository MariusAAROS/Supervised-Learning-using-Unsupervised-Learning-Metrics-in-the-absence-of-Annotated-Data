gensini score assesses the severity of coronary artery disease : it grades narrowing of the lumen of the coronary artery and scores it as 1 for 1 25% narrowing , 2 for 26 50% narrowing , 4 for 51 75% , 8 for 76 90% , 16 for 91 99% and 32 for a completely occluded artery. gensini score was expressed as the sum of the scores for all three coronary arteries to evaluate the entire extent of coronary artery disease ( 23 ). gensini score assesses the severity of coronary artery disease : it grades narrowing of the lumen of the coronary artery and scores it as 1 for 1 25% narrowing , 2 for 26 50% narrowing , 4 for 51 75% , 8 for 76 90% , 16 for 91 99% and 32 for a completely occluded artery. gensini score was expressed as the sum of the scores for all three coronary arteries to evaluate the entire extent of coronary artery disease ( 23 ). the present study found that there was a strong association between adiponectin and coronary artery disease. relatively small sample of patients that were selected randomly from the general population , may have limited the ability to detect significant relationship between adiponectin and coronary artery disease , thus making it difficult to indicate the results to the general population. there is a significant positive correlation between waist hip ratio and severity of coronary artery disease.
