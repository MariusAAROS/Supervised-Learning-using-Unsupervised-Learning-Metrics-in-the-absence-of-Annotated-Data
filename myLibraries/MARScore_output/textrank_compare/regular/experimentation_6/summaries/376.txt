the aim of this study was to investigate system wide changes in protein expression during growth on dibenzofuran , a nontoxic surrogate for dibenzo p dioxin , as compared to nonselective growth media. therefore , global analyses of protein expression profiles may be a more informative tool for understanding the physiological mechanisms of biodegradation. the unchanged proteins represented basic cell functions , although biosynthesis , catabolism , and transport proteins dominated the identities. image analysis of 24 cm 2d dige gels loaded with protein of s. wittichii rw1 cells grown on either dibenzofuran or acetate revealed 937 unique spots. common sources include backyard burning , incineration of plastics , and chlorine bleaching of pulp in paper mills. documented health effects include acute and chronic effects , including chloracne , various types of cancers , reproductive diseases , circulatory and respiratory diseases , and diabetes. the traditional approach to environmental remediation includes a host of physical and chemical methods , depending on the characteristics of the polluted site and the extent of contamination present.
