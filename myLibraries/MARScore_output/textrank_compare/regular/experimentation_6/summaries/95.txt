, in a study of 110 cases of bone lesions attributed the missed diagnosis in two cases of chondroblastoma at fnac to inadequate sampling and misinterpretation as giant cell tumor. in giant cell tumor , the mononuclear cells are spindle shaped and occur in clusters. in addition to chondroblastoma , abc can occur secondarily in giant cell tumor and osteosarcoma. however , errors in the fnac diagnosis of this rare tumor are known to occur , with the major pitfalls being its association with aneurysmal bone cyst ( abc ) leading to a nonrepresentative aspirate and the occurrence of a plethora of giant cell rich lesions in the differentials. aspirates in abc are usually hemorrhagic , scantily cellular , composed of osteoclast giant cells , histiocytes , osteoblasts , and spindle cells. this report reiterates the cytomorphologic findings in chondroblastoma and its differential diagnosis from other giant cell containing lesions of bone. chondroblastoma accounts for < 1% of all primary bone tumors.
