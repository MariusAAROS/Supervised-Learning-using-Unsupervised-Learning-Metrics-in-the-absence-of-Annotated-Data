a series of 91 consecutive patients with primary hyperparathyroidism underwent parathyroidectomy guided by intraoperative pth at federal university of so paulo , brazil , from june 2000 to april 2011. focused parathyroidectomy guided by intraoperative pth was the initial procedure when preoperative localization tests were positive and when there were no suspicion of malignant disease. a bilateral cervical exploration guided by intraoperative pth was performed when preoperative localization tests were negative. otherwise , further surgical exploration of the neck would have to be carried on.. intraoperative pth was measured using elecsys pth immunoassay ( elecsys 1010 system , roche , mannheim , germany ). the iopth accuracy calculation was based on the following definitions : a true positive ( tp ) result of iopth was defined as the correct prediction of postoperative normal calcium levels for at least 6 months ; true negative ( tn ) was the correct prediction of incomplete excision by either resection of an additional gland(s ) or operative failure ; false positive ( fp ) was the incorrect prediction of normocalcemia with subsequent postoperative persistent hypercalcemia and high pth levels ; false negative ( fn ) was the incorrect prediction of incomplete excision followed by postoperative normocalcemia. all patients had their age , gender , symptoms ( bone and kidney ) , preoperative localization tests , serum ionized calcium ( ica ) , serum total calcium and intact pth recorded before parathyroidectomy , as well as iopth dosages. serum ionized calcium ( 1.151.32 mmol / l ) , serum total calcium ( 8.510.5 mg / dl ) and intact pth ( 1167 pg / ml ) , were measured using standard automatic assays.
