common side effects of arbs are well known and include hyperkalaemia , hypotension , and impaired renal function , similar to ace inhibitors ; however , arbs are believed to be better tolerated than ace inhibitors. two benchmark randomized controlled trials , namely the cooperative north scandinavian enalapril survival study7 and the studies of left ventricular dysfunction treatment trial,8 demonstrated that ace inhibitors reduce mortality and improved new york heart association class , exercise capacity and cardiac function in patients with hf with reduced ef. subsequently , the assessment of treatment with lisinopril and survival study5 investigated whether ace inhibitors had favourable effects on the outcome of patients with hf with reduced ef in a dosedependent manner. five ace inhibitors , namely ramipril , enalapril , lisinopril , captopril , and trandolapril , are listed for the treatment of hf with reduced ef , and the starting dose and the target dose are also described in the current guidelines.3 however , it remains unclear which ace inhibitor should be administered or if there are differences between the drugs , because headtohead comparisons are still missing. doserelated increase in the development of adverse events in patients receiving both benazepril and valsartan is observed , which is inconsistent with the findings of previous studies using very highdose arb.12 , 13 in view of these findings , arbs are considered second choice in patients with hf with reduced ef who are not tolerated to ace inhibitors or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in the current guidelines. in patients with hf , increased raas contributes to the pathogenesis , and ace inhibitors reduce the activity of the raas by inhibiting the production of angiotensin ii. further research should reveal whether ace inhibitors at supramaximal dose reduce the mortality rate in patients with hf compared with those at high dose.
