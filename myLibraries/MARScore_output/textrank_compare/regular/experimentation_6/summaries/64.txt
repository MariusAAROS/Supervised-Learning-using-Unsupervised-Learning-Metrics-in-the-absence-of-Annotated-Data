these results are in alignment with our findings that suggest that there are additional cardiovascular benefits associated with the achievement of both ldl c and hba1c goals when compared with only hba1c goal achievement , while there are additional microvascular benefits associated with the achievement of both hba1c and ldl c goals when compared with only ldl c goal achievement. these results are in alignment with our findings that suggest that there are additional cardiovascular benefits associated with the achievement of both ldl c and hba1c goals when compared with only hba1c goal achievement , while there are additional microvascular benefits associated with the achievement of both hba1c and ldl c goals when compared with only ldl c goal achievement. after adjusting for demographics , diabetes related complications , comorbidities , surgical procedures , diabetic medication use , and health care utilization , dual goal achievers incurred significantly lower annualized diabetes related medical service costs compared with those who achieved only the ldl c goal ( $130.89 ; p = 0.016 ) , but no statistically significant difference was observed between dual goal achievers and hba1c goal achievers ( $56.17 ; p = 0.404 ) ( fig. after adjusting for demographics , diabetes related complications , comorbidities , surgical procedures , diabetic medication use , and health care utilization , dual goal achievers incurred significantly lower annualized diabetes related medical service costs compared with those who achieved only the ldl c goal ( $130.89 ; p = 0.016 ) , but no statistically significant difference was observed between dual goal achievers and hba1c goal achievers ( $56.17 ; p = 0.404 ) ( fig. the study results showed that , compared with the achievement of only the ldl c goal , achievement of both hba1c and ldl c goals is associated with a lower risk of microvascular complications , acs , and cardiovascular surgeries ( pci or cabg ) , lower utilization of health care resources , and lower costs of care , but no additional effect was observed for the composite cardiovascular related end point. during the first cycle , 35.1% of patients achieved both goals ( dual goal achievers ) , whereas 21.6% achieved only the ldl c goal ( ldl c achievers ) , 24.6% achieved only the hba1c goal ( hba1c achievers ) , and 18.6% did not achieve either goal ( no goal achievers ) ( table 1 ). compared with all other groups , dual goal achievers were older ( 67.1 vs. 61.464.4 years ).
