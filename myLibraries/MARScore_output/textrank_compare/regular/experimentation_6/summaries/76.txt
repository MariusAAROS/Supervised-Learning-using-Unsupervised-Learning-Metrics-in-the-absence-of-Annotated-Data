were significantly decreased in the clp + baicalin group ( p=0.0181 and 0.0225 ) , indicating that baicalin treatment effectively alleviated kidney injury in the clp induced mouse sepsis model. tunel assay showed more apoptotic cells in the clp group compared to the sham group , and baicalin treatment reduced apoptotic cell numbers ( figure 3a ) , with significant differences between groups ( p=0.0087 and 0.0359 , figure 3b ). qrt pcr results showed that bax mrna level was significantly elevated in the clp group ( p=0.0108 ) and then was down regulated by baicalin treatment ( p=0.0256 , figure 4a ). both bun and cr levels were significantly decreased in the clp + baicalin group ( p=0.0181 and 0.0225 ) , indicating that baicalin treatment effectively alleviated kidney injury in the clp induced mouse sepsis model. tunel assay showed more apoptotic cells in the clp group compared to the sham group , and baicalin treatment reduced apoptotic cell numbers ( figure 3a ) , with significant differences between groups ( p=0.0087 and 0.0359 , figure 3b ). qrt pcr results showed that bax mrna level was significantly elevated in the clp group ( p=0.0108 ) and then was down regulated by baicalin treatment ( p=0.0256 , figure 4a ). thus , in the present study we chose to perform baicalin treatment in the model mouse via intragastric administration of 200 mg/(kgd ) for 6 days , and the significantly elevated bun and cr levels in the clp group compared to the sham group indicated that this treatment method effectively induced kidney injury in the mouse sepsis model.
