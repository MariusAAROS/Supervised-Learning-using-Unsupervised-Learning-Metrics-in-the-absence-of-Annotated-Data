toe gripping strength of the dominant toe and emg activity of the ipsilateral thigh were synchronously recorded to assess the activity of the rectus femoris and biceps femoris muscles. in the present study , we investigated femoral muscle activity during toe gripping to examine the role of the femoral muscles in toe gripping strength. low toe gripping strength is a risk factor of falls for the elderly , and several studies have reported that toe gripping strength is lower in subjects with a history of falls than in those with no history of falls1,2,3,4. repeated mann whitney u tests were used to compare the % iemg of the rectus and biceps femoris muscles. the % iemg of the biceps femoris was significantly higher than that of the rectus femoris ( p < 0.01 , table 1table 1.comparison of the % iemg values of the rectus femoris and biceps femoris muscles during toe gripping actionrectus femorisbiceps femorismedian ( range : min max)median ( range : min max)%iemg4.8 * ( 1.521.1)27.2 ( 3.068.1)mann whitney u test * : p < 0.05 ). toe gripping strength is measured in the sitting position with the trunk vertical , the hip and knee joints at 90 , and the ankle joint in the neutral position1,2,3. furthermore , toe gripping strength can be increased by training5 , which can decrease the risk of falls1..
