both physicians and patients were aware of the severity and frequency of previous exacerbations at baseline. we conducted a 1year prospective observational trial in a daily life setting involving 90 japanese patients with copd to investigate whether previous moderate to severe exacerbations are associated with future exacerbations in this patient population. copd patients were divided into three groups , based on the total number of moderate and severe exacerbations within the last year before enrollment in the study , ie , non ( previous moderate and severe exacerbations , 0/year ) , infrequent ( one exacerbation / year ) , and frequent ( two or more exacerbations / year ) exacerbator groups , in accordance with a previous report.16 in addition , patients with previous hospitalizations were classified as having a subphenotype with severe exacerbation ( severe exacerbators ). copd patients were divided into three groups , based on the total number of moderate and severe exacerbations within the last year before enrollment in the study , ie , non ( previous moderate and severe exacerbations , 0/year ) , infrequent ( one exacerbation / year ) , and frequent ( two or more exacerbations / year ) exacerbator groups , in accordance with a previous report.16 in addition , patients with previous hospitalizations were classified as having a subphenotype with severe exacerbation ( severe exacerbators ). figure 2 also shows that among the frequent exacerbators , the number of patients who subsequently suffered severe exacerbations ( requiring one or more hospitalizations ) was two ( 11.8% ) , and frequent ( two or more exacerbations / year ) , infrequent ( one exacerbation / year ) , and no moderate or severe exacerbations were seven ( 42.1% ) , six ( 35.3% ) , and four ( 23.5% ) , respectively , whereas seven ( 63.6% ) of eleven infrequent and 37 ( 74.0% ) of 50 nonexacerbators experienced no further exacerbation. among five ( 5.6% ) of the severe exacerbators , two ( 40.0% ) had subsequently suffered severe exacerbations. in subanalysis , there was no difference in the proportion of patients who had subsequently suffered severe exacerbations between the frequent and severe exacerbator groups ( p>0.05 ).
