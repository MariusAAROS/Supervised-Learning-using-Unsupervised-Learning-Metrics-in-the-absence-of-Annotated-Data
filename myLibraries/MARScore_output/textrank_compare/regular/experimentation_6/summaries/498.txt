( b ) the presynaptic terminals of the primary sensory afferents contain excess substance p following morphine + fosaprepitant treatment ( red ). the results of this study show that combining morphine with fosaprepitant ( group iv ) delayed the development of morphine tolerance and concurrently increased the antinociceptive effect compared to the control group. the results indicate that addition of fosaprepitant to morphine can delay morphine tolerance for a limited period of time. hot plate latency or the thermal escape behaviour was determined in the morning , 40 min after saline ( group i ) , fosaprepitant ( group iii ) , or morphine injection ( group ii and iv ). a 40 s , cut off was fixed to prevent damage to the completely analgesic paw after morphine injection. morphine injection produced significantly higher antinociceptive effect on day 1 ( p < 0.001 ) and to a lesser extent day 4 ( p < 0.05 ) compared to the control group. male sprague dawley rats ( n = 24 ) weighing approximately 250 g were used for the study.
