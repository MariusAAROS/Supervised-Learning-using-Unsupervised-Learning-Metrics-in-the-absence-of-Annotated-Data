suicide is one of the leading causes of death throughout the world ; it ranks among the top 10 causes of death for individuals of all ages and is the leading cause of death in males under 35 years old.1,2 a decrease in the concentrations of serotonin metabolites ( in particular the serotonin 5hydroxyindoleacetic ) in patients with suicide behavior ( suicide attempt and suicide ) suggests that the serotonergic system is associated with suicide behavior.3,4 studies have consistently proposed that genes of the serotonergic system could play an important role in suicide.5,6 for example , in sh sy5y cells , the administration of human interferon alpha modifies the htr2c mrna editing , and this could be a mechanism of drug induced depression or suicidal side effects in humans.7,8 it has also been proposed that the serotonin receptor 2c ( htr2c ) control studies have obtained both positive and negative findings.1315,1620 in addition , to date , the relationship between the htr2c gene and suicide behavior in the mexican population has not yet been studied. 5ht2a , 5ht2b , and 5ht2c.1 the gene that encodes the htr2c is located on the long arm of the x chromosome at position 24 ; and it contains six exons and five introns , spanning at least 230 kb.12 one of the most common variants of the htr2c is the cys23ser ( rs6318 ) , which is a functional polymorphism ( c / g at position 68 ) that results in the substitution of cysteine for serine at position 23 of the n terminal extracellular domain.2,13,14 in the last few years , several authors have reported an association between the htr2c polymorphism and suicidal behavior.15 furthermore , in analyses performed by gender , a negative association has been observed between the htr2c polymorphism and suicidal behavior.14,16 other polymorphisms of htr2c that also have been studied in suicide behavior are rs547536 , rs2192372 , rs2428707 , and rs4272555;14 however , no association has been established in several populations. the objective of this work was to analyze the association by gender between five genetic variants of htr2c gene , rs547536 , rs2192372 , rs6318 , rs2428707 , and rs4272555 , and suicide attempt in a mexican population. we defined suicide attempt as a self harm behavior with at least some intent to end one s life. the htr2c variants rs4272555 and rs2428707 were significantly associated with suicide attempt in this mexican population. the g allele of the snp rs2428707 was associated with an increased risk of suicide attempt ( p=0.01 , odd ratio [ or ] = 3.68 , 95% confidence inrterval [ ci ] : 1.2410.90 ) , while the c allele of the snp rs4272555 was associated with a decreased risk of suicide attempt ( p=0.01 , or = 0.26 , 95% ci : 0.090.79 ).
