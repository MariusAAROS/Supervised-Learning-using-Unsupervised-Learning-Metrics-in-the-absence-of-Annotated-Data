the 11 panels of peptides sarotup scanned , there were target unrelated peptides in 3 panels from cetuximab , 80r , and b12 test case , respectively ( table 3 ). peptides displayed on these phages are called target unrelated peptides ( tup ) , a term coined recently by menendez and scott in a review.. the results from phage display technology might be a mixture of target unrelated peptides and mimotopes , and it can be difficult to discriminate tup from mimotopes since the binding assays used to confirm the affinity of peptides for the target often employ the same components as the initial panning experiment. obviously , target unrelated peptides are not appropriate candidates for the development of new diagnostics , therapeutics , and vaccines. there are now quite a few programs for mimotope based epitope mapping , none of them , however , has a procedure to scan , report and exclude target unrelated peptides [ 1523 ]. recently , menendez and scott reviewed a collection of target unrelated peptides recovered in the screening of phage displayed random peptide libraries with antibodies. very recently , brammer et al. reported a completely new type of target unrelated peptides. if target unrelated peptides were found , a new panel of peptides excluding tup was produced.
