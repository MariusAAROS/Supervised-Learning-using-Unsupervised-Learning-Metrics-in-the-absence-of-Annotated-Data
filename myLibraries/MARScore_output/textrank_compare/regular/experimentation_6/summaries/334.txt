we calculate the electric field at a given dot a about atom a2where n is the number of solute atoms , ria represents a vector from atom i to surface dot a , and ria is its length ; signa = 1 when raai=1n ( qi / ria3)ria 0 , and signa = 1 when raai=1n ( qi / ria3)ria < 0 , and raa is the vector from atom a to dot a. from the electric field , we calculate the corresponding charge by3where , we find that when the tip3p gsolv is weak , for example , when the charge density of solute atoms is low , the fixed rw boundary works fairly well. one solute atom is strongly charged , leading to two consequences : its own solvating water molecule is pulled in tightly , and neighboring solute atoms have tighter water interactions too. this partial culling process simply removes potential numerical instabilities from surface sites overlapping solute atom centers while providing some adjustable starting surface sites that penetrate within the fixed rw boundary. the adaptive nature of the boundary only pertains to multiatom solutes ; the adaptive and fixed rw boundaries are identical for single atom solutes , like monatomic ions. there is a need for computer methods that can calculate the aqueous solvation free energies of solute molecules accurately and efficiently. explicit solvent models provide a physically accurate and atomistically detailed model of solvent , but they can be computationally expensive.
