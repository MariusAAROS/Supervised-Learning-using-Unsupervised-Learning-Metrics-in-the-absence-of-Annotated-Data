as expected , female life span was decreased by extreme inbreeding , but surprisingly , male life span was increased. differences in life span between males and females are commonly observed across many species. genetic and environmental interventions that affect life span tend to have a greater effect in one sex than the other. signaling and dietary restriction tend to increase life span more in females than males in drosophila and mammals , whereas mild stress tends to increase life span more in males than in females , at least in drosophila. quantitative genetic analyses have revealed a different genetic architecture of life span in males versus females. for example , quantitative trait loci ( qtls ) that affect life span are often sex specific or sex biased in drosophila , mice and humans , and studies over the past few years show strikingly different effects of inbreeding in male versus female insects. taken together , all these data suggest that the genetic differences between males and females have a significant effect upon aging and life span.
