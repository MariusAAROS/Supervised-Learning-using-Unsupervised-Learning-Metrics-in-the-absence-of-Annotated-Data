importantly , gal9 levels were negatively correlated with il17 ( r = 0.45 , p < 0.001 ; figure 3(a ) ) however , gal9 levels showed no correlation with il4 concentrations ( r = 0.04 , p = 0.528 ; figure 3(b ) ). as we expected , gal9 levels were found to be negatively correlated with hs crp ( r = 0.37 , p < 0.001 ; figure 5(a ) ) , the gensini score ( r = 0.23 , p = 0.001 ; figure 5(b ) ) , fpg ( r = 0.15 , p = 0.027 ; figure 5(c ) ) , and lipoprotein(a ) interestingly , gal9 levels were showed to be negatively correlated with il17 and ifn but positively associated with tgf1. secondly , given the cross sectional design of the study , the causal relationship between gal9 level and the severity of coronary artery stenosis can not be determined. herein , we investigate serum gal9 levels in chinese patients with cad , and the severity of coronary arteries stenosis was evaluated by gensini score. among the total 232 study participants , serum gal9 levels ranged from 1733.86 to 5259.39 pg / ml.
