although previous reports have dealt with the clinical features and management of this problem , an optimal approach to prevent postoperative pericardial effusion and related problems has not been clearly defined [ 3 , 5 ]. pericardial effusion , which is a common complication after coronary artery surgery ( cas ) , may be the cause of significant morbidity. this study aims to investigate the effects of posterior pericardiotomy ( pp ) on the development of pericardial effusion , tamponade , and atrial fibrillation following cas. pericardial effusion was defined as the accumulation of fluid in the pericardial space determined by transthoracic echocardiography ( tte ). the presence of pericardial effusion on 2dimensional tte was assessed using the criteria previously described by bakhshandeh et al.. two dimensional echocardiography was performed on postoperative days 1 and 5 , as well as 1 month after surgery. the average volume of pericardial effusion significantly decreased with time in groups i and ii ( fig. figure 1 shows a comparison of the groups with regard to the volume of pericardial effusion.
