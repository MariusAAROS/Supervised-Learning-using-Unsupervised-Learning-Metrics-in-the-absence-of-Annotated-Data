the sep and cognitive measurement models were combined in a structural equation model ( figure 2 ) estimating regression paths from neighborhood level sep to the cognitive constructs of. while neighborhood effects on late life cognition have received less attention , neighborhood effects on early life cognitive development are relatively well documented. neighborhood effects may support some dimensions of cognition more strongly than others , in addition to influencing general cognitive status. the present study aimed to identify whether neighborhood effects on cognition were global , or specifically related to particular cognitive domains such as memory , reasoning , processing speed , everyday cognition , or vocabulary. another innovation of the present study is the capacity to address whether neighborhood effects might also influence the magnitude of potential benefit from cognitive intervention. elucidating both the specificity of neighborhood effects on particular domains of cognition and. if so , we aimed to discern whether neighborhood effects were significant for general cognitive ability ( g ) , and whether effects were differential for specific cognitive abilities ( memory , reasoning , speed , everyday cognition , and vocabulary ).
