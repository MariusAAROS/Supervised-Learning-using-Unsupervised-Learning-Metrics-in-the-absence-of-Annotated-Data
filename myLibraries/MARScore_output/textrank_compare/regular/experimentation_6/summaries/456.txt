babies with low birth weight ( lbw ) and extremely lbw account for 6 7% and 1% of babies death , respectively. management , appropriate care , and supportive cares are the important factors in preventing babies death. based on single variable analysis , neonatal risk factors affecting the newborn babies hospitalized in the nicu are as follows : 51.6% of case babies and 18.3% of control babies had first minute apgar score of less than 6 , which proved to have a significant correlation with babies death ( p < 0.001 ). fourteen percent of case babies and 2% of control babies had sepsis which showed a significant relation with babies death ( p < 0.001 ). in our study , ncpap was applied in the control group two times more than in the case group , which resulted in a decrease of babies death by 0.43. appropriately carrying out care and supportive cares can be effective factors in preventing babies death. therefore , regarding the fourth goal of millennium development , decreasing babies death to two fourths by 2015 in countries with high rate of mortality , it seems to be better to spot pregnancies with high risk of babies death through pre delivery care and to transfer mothers who are likely to bear premature or sick babies to centers that have nicus.
