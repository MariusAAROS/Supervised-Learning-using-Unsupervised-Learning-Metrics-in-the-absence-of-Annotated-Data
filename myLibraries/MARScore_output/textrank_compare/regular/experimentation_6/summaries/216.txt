consequently , a more accurate , robust and faster method that does not rely on sequence alignment is needed to distinguish ncrnas , especially lncrnas , from protein coding genes. second , considerable fractions of lncrnas are overlapped with either the sense or antisense strand of protein coding genes. these lncrnas can not be correctly classified by homology searching because they would have significant matches to protein coding genes ( 3,8,19 ). this test set composed of 4000 high quality protein coding genes ( refseq annotated ) and 4000 lncrnas from a human lncrna catalog ( 5 ). one possible explanation is that a significant proportion of ncrnas has a certain degree of sequence similarity to protein coding genes. until now , prediction of coding potential heavily relied on sequence alignment , either pairwise homology search for protein evidence such as that used in the coding potential calculator ( cpc ) and portrait methods ( 15,16 ) or multiple alignments to calculate the phylogenetic conservation score such as that used in the phylogenetic codon substitution frequencies ( phylocsf ) and rnacode methods ( 17,18 ). orf length is one of the most fundamental features used to distinguish ncrna from messenger rna because a long putative orf is unlikely to be observed by random chance in noncoding sequences.
