several reviews have been published on the plant cwi maintenance mechanism illustrating the increased interest in this area ( humphrey et al. , 2007 ; hematy et al. , 2009 ; ringli , 2010 ; seifert and blaukopf , 2010 ). the1 was isolated as a suppressor of the cellulose deficient cesa6 procuste ( pre ) mutant , which exhibits a hypocotyl elongation defect ( hematy et al. , 2007 ). plant cell walls are capable of adjusting their composition and structure in response to pathogen infection ( dong et al. , 2008 ). the available evidence suggests that a dedicated plant cell wall integrity ( cwi ) maintenance mechanism exists ( wolf et al. , 2011 ). a recently published review focuses on cwi maintenance during plant cell wall morphogenesis ( wolf et al. , 2011 ). the available phenotypic and genetic data also implicate turgor pressure , mechano perception , and cwd detection in plant cwi maintenance ( hamann et al. interestingly , arabidopsis histidine kinase1 ( ahk1 ) and cytokinin receptor1/arabidopsis histidine kinase4 ( cre1/ahk4 ) can at least partially rescue a yeast strain with a loss of function allele in sln1 ( urao et al.
