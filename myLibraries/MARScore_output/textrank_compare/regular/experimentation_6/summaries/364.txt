these models overestimated the risk of disease recurrence and progression in high risk patients. , both the eortc and the cueto risk tables exhibit a poor discrimination for prognostic outcomes and overestimate the risk of disease recurrence and progression in high risk patients in external validation. in the prognostic factor meta analysis of 33 studies of high grade t1 bladder cancer patients (. n = 8880 ) , the highest impact risk factor for progression and cancer specific survival was depth of invasion ( t1b / c ) into the lamina propria. there was no clearly defined nmp22 cut off that could indicate higher risk disease , but there was a continuum of risk for recurrence and progression. photodynamic diagnosis with blue light and narrow band imaging have been shown to reduce residual tumor rates by roughly 20% and to improve recurrence free survival of nmibc patients compared with white light cystoscopy. nmibc patients with progression to muscle invasive disease tend to have worse prognosis compared with patients with primary muscle invasive disease , and it underscores the need to significantly improve risk stratification and earlier definitive treatment for high risk nmibc. bladder cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed genitourinary malignancy in the usa , with an estimated 74,000 newly diagnosed cases and 16,000 deaths in 2015.
