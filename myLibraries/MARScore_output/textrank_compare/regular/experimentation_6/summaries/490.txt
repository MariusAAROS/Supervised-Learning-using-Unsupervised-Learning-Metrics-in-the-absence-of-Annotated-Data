multilocular cystic rcc represents a rare entity that was recognized in 1982 , with a reported incidence of 1 4% of all rccs. since multilocular cystic rcc could not be excluded , the patient underwent right laparoscopic radical nephrectomy. because multilocular cystic rcc are more likely to be discovered incidentally , this feature may contribute to their excellent prognosis compared to that of conventional rccs. they found that in a high proportion of cases , multilocular cystic rcc reacted strongly with the distal nephron markers , but none reacted preferentially with proximal nephron markers. these results illustrate that multilocular cystic rcc originates from the distal nephron , although the precise pathogenesis of cystic formation in multilocular cystic rcc has not been elucidated clearly. the coexistence of multilocular cystic rcc and leiomyoma has not been documented. recently , imura et al. carried out a detailed immunohistochemical analysis of multilocular cystic rcc cases.
