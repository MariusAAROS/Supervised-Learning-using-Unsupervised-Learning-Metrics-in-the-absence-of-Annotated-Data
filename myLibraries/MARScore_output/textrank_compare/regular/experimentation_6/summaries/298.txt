figure 6 shows histology of a donor eye with ga , for which local relationships and cellular processes in the interior of outer retinal corrugations were particularly clear yet also representative of other ga eyes available for review. figure 6 shows histology of a donor eye with ga , for which local relationships and cellular processes in the interior of outer retinal corrugations were particularly clear yet also representative of other ga eyes available for review. the plateau surface was highly reflective on both cross sectional and en face oct ( fig. 4 , en face oct surface ) and showed the presence of focal defects ( fig. 4 , blue arrows ) that were usually accompanied by smaller hyperreflective foci seen beneath the hyperreflective border. octa , and on oct surface ( an en face oct slab at the level of the rpe bl atop the plateau ) , the plateau interior is bounded by a distinct hyperreflective band that continues as a thick and highly reflective rpe band. the plateau surface was highly reflective on both cross sectional and en face oct ( fig. 4 , en face oct surface ) and showed the presence of focal defects ( fig. 4 , yellow arrows ). octa , and on oct surface ( an en face oct slab at the level of the rpe bl atop the plateau ) , the plateau interior is bounded by a distinct hyperreflective band that continues as a thick and highly reflective rpe band. these extracted sd oct images were then stacked , aligned , and saved as a video file using the fiji distribution ( fiji is just image j ,.
