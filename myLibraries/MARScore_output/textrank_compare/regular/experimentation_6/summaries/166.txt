with the goal of discovering the genes that contribute to the risk of common diseases , numerous susceptibility loci have been identified using linkage analysis. additional parameters included heritability , a quantitative trait locus ( qtl ) effect in linkage analysis , and an additive snp effect in association analysis. as evidence , they identified variants in five genes that fully accounted for a linkage peak for plasma triglyceride level.. if small effects are typical of common disease susceptibility genes , their detection through linkage analysis may be limited to locations where the genes cluster. the fine mapping of five chromosomal regions allowed us not only to confirm our genome scan linkages , but also to infer the presence of multiple t2d susceptibility genes in each of the regions. although chromosome 18 failed to show t2d linkage and chromosome 7 failed to show aod linkage. likelihood analysis , as implemented in jpap , was used for univariate linkage analysis of unadjusted t2d ( ut2d ) , t2d adjusted for bmi ( bt2d ) , and aod and for bivariate association analysis of ut2d and aod. despite replication of many of these linkages in a second sample ,.
