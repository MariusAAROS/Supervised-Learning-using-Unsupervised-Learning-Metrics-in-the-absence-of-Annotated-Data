malaria incidence per 1,000 population ( black lines ) and mean monthly precipitation ( blue lines ) during la nia ( orange bars ) and el nio ( red bars ) events for the states of a ) amazonas , b ) mato grosso , and c ) roraima. wetland colors correspond to percentage wetland values in panel d. b ) risk ratios for malaria incidence for 1 sd ( 14 cm ) change in monthly precipitation ( january 1996december 1999 ) , plotted at each county seat of government ; c ) spatially smoothed risk ratios for 14cm changes in monthly precipitation. d ) boxplot of risk ratios for malaria incidence for 14cm changes in monthly precipitation , by percentage wetland cover. , we estimated the rate ratio of malaria incidence associated with 1 sd increase in monthly precipitation ( 14 cm ) for each county by using the following poisson regression model , which includes a flexible temporal trend represented as a natural cubic spline with 6 degrees of freedom ( figure 2 , panel b ) : malariait poisson(it ) our results suggest that monthly precipitation along the amazon basin can have both strong positive and negative associations with malaria incidence. the aim is to describe the variable patterns of malaria incidence and precipitation , not create a highly predictive model. to assess the association between malaria incidence and precipitation data.
