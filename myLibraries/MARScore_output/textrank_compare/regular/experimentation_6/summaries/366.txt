in order to determine the efficiency of single cell pcr and allele drop out ( ado ) rate , primers used for the detection of the causative mutation and y chromosome specific sry gene were tested using single lymphocytes ( table 1 ). gender selection with fish for y chromosome specific loci is more reliable because amplification failure could occasionally occur in single cell pcr. most pgd cycles for x linked disorders such as duchenne muscular dystrophy and fragile x syndrome involved the selection of female embryos which were diagnosed as normal or heterozygous. the genotype of the baby for the exon 9 of otc gene and level of ammonia were confirmed as normal. we could not absolutely exclude the possibility of ado in the diagnosis of unaffected female embryo owing to the relatively higher ado. in the last decade , preimplantation genetic diagnosis ( pgd ) has become an important alternative to prenatal diagnosis for couples at high risk of transmitting inherited disorders to their children. fluorescence in situ hybridization ( fish ) has been offered for gender selection in x linked diseases ( 1 , 2 ) , chromosomal translocations ( 3 5 ) , aneuploidy , and recurrent implantation failure ( 6 , 7 ).
