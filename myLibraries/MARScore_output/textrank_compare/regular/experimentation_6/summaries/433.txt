pre operative modifiable and non modifiable risk factors ; measures the surgeon can adopt to reduce impact of risk factors on development of pji pji , peri prosthetic joint infections ; bmi , body mass index ; hba1c , glycated haemoglobin ; mrsa , methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus ; s. aureus , staphylococcus aureus other potential pre operative risk factors are intra articular corticosteroid injections and any infectious disease , particularly urinary tract infection ( uti ) and nasal colonisation with staphylococcus ( s. ) aureus. the risk factors potentially correlated with acute pji infection can be divided into pre operative ( usually related to patient comorbidities ) , peri operative and post operative , which are mainly linked to the behaviours of the surgeon and the hospital staff. in a level ii. study , cai et al concluded that advanced surgical dressings such as hydrofibre may contribute to a reduction in the incidence of acute pji. infection represents a major challenge in tja , and is costly and demanding to manage for both surgeons and patients. however , a recent cochrane review showed no evidence that adhesive drapes reduce surgical site infection rates. the number of total joint arthroplasties ( tjas ) performed has increased steadily in recent years , with projected numbers for the coming years rising further. consequently. according to recent data , peri prosthetic joint infection ( pji ) incidence constitutes between approximately 0.3% and 1.7% of all total hip arthroplasties ( tha ) , and between 0.8% and 1.9% of all total knee arthroplasties ( tka ).
