his father had prostate cancer and died at age 75 years from colon cancer ; a sister had breast cancer and a maternal uncle had throat cancer. a patient with dual functioning kidneys presenting with uraemic symptoms and suspected to have obstructive uropathy must be presumed to necessarily have bilateral renal obstruction [ 610 ]. we would like to remind practicing providers that symptomatic uraemia presenting in the setting of suspected obstructive uropathy must be assumed to imply bilateral renal obstruction , regardless of the results / interpretations of any form of conventional renal imaging. symptomatic supravesical obstructive uropathy in a patient with dual functioning kidneys is classically characterized by bilateral hydroureters / hydronephrosis and an empty urinary bladder. this obstruction may be secondary to metastatic abdomino pelvic and retroperitoneal malignancies , ureteric calculi and retroperitoneal fibrosis [ 25 ].. the evidence for obstruction may be partially or totally absent on ultrasound or computerized tomography , in one or both kidneys [ 68 ]. our recent experience with a uraemic 56year old caucasian showing only unilateral moderate right sided hydronephrosis is presented. a 56year old caucasian male patient with a past medical history that included hypertension and coronary artery disease and a recent serum creatinine of 88.4 mol / l , was diagnosed 10 days earlier with urinary tract infection ( uti ).
