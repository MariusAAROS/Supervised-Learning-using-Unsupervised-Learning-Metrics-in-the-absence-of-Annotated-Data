in addition , in in vivo models , triapine was active against hu resistant l1210 and kb cell lines and caused significant inhibition of solid tumor growth in mouse xenograft models ( finch et al. further studies have examined the radiosensitizing properties of triapine in a number of human cell lines. this is supported by a number of studies , including one by kuo et al. , who characterized the response of rr in the human cervical cancer cell line , caski. even though the precise mechanism of r2 response to ir damage is unclear , work has shown that human nasopharyngeal cancer cells overexpressing r2 demonstrate a significant increase in radioresistance and fewer dna double strand breaks ( dsb ) after exposure to ir ( kuo et al. , 2003 ) , confirming the concept that r2 is important in the cellular response to ir. , work has continued on examining the mechanism by which it sensitizes cells to the effects of ir. in particular , work by kuo et al. has shown that the sequence with which cells are treated with hu plays an important role. they demonstrated that in the caski cervical cancer cell line , clinically relevant concentrations of hu had a significant interaction with ir , with post ir exposure > pre ir ( kuo et al. , 1997 ). in addition , in cells overexpressing the r2 subunit , hu is able to return ir sensitivity to baseline ( kuo et al. , 2003 ) , demonstrating that r2 inhibition is the likely mechanism for hu radiosensitization in these cells. in in vitro experiments , it was shown to inhibit rr with an ic50 of 26 m ( hashemy et al. , 2006 ) , although given that it has a number of other cellular effects , it is unclear how much of its potency as a radiosensitizer is due to rr inhibition alone.
