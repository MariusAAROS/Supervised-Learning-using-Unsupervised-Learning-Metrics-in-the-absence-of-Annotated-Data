, each selected gene has a combined variable importance score that is less than or equal to n. to verify sex specific biomarkers , we consider the following four different cases : we classify the outcome of ( 1 ) male patients with a set of male specific genes smj,(2 ) female patients with a set of male specific genes smj,(3 ) male patients with a set of female specific genes sfj , and ( 4 ) female patients with a set of female specific genes sfj. thirdly , the mutually exclusive sets of male specific genes and female specific genes are obtained. we anticipate that data with a set of male specific genes have higher predictable power to predict male patients than the data with female specific genes. similarly , data with female specific genes have higher predictable power to predict female patients than the data with male specific genes. these nine top ranked genes which were selected at least 75% of the time in the entire loocv were considered as potential female specific genomic biomarkers to classify female patients into r / cr. data with male specific genes showed higher prediction accuracy ( 71.9% ) to classify male patients than the accuracy ( 43.8% ) to classify male patients from data with female specific genes. similarly , data with female specific genes showed higher prediction accuracy ( 76.2% ) to classify female patients than the accuracy ( 61.9% ) to classify female patients from data with male specific genes. at the end of loocv trials , a set of male specific genes that were selected at least 75% of the time in the entire loocv were 1882gat ( mecom :
