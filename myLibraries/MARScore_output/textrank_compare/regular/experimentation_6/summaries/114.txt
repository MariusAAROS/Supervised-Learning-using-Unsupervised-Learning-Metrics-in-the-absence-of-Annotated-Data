the arrhythmogenic potential of sevoflurane is likely to be enhanced as ca channel blockers inhibit the entry of ca into the cell or its mobilisation from intracellular stores , while b adrenergic blockers depresses sinus rate and av node conduction. preoperative 12 lead electrocardiograms ( ecg ) showed sinus rhythm with a rate of 60/min. diazepam 10 mg was administered orally the night before and 60 minutes before surgery , along with morning dose of metoprolol and amlodipine. baseline pr was 88/min with sinus rhythm ; spo2 , 99% on room air and nibp , 96/62 mmhg. preoperative 12 lead electrocardiograms ( ecg ) showed sinus rhythm with a rate of 60/min. diazepam 10 mg was administered orally the night before and 60 minutes before surgery , along with morning dose of metoprolol and amlodipine. baseline pr was 88/min with sinus rhythm ; spo2 , 99% on room air and nibp , 96/62 mmhg. isravd was recorded during induction of anaesthesia with sevoflurane which reverted back to sinus rhythm after discontinuation of sevoflurane during emergence. reported a case of intraoperative torsades de pointes ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation during sevoflurane anaesthesia , which persisted with dc shock but reverted to sinus rhythm after 10 minutes of discontinuation of sevoflurane and after the patient was awakened.
