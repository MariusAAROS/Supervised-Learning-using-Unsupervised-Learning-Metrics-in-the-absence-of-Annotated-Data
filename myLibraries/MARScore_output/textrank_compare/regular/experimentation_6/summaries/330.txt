the average age of h. pylori positive patients was 30.3 years old ( standard deviation = 7.6 ) , while the average age of h. pylori negative patients was 33.4 years ( standard deviation = 9.7 ). polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) is the desired method of proving the presence of h. pylori in tissues due to its high sensitivity and specificity ( 5 , 6 ). it was previously thought that the human stomach was the sole source of h. pylori ; however , it was later found that they are present in human dental plaques , mouth , saliva , tonsils , adenoids , middle ear , nasal polyps and sinus mucosa ( 7 ). samples from tonsil and adenoid tissues showed that they might be sources of h. pylori ( 10 , 11 ). many studies have been conducted on otitis media with effusion and on its correlation with h. pylori ( 15 , 17 19 ). so , we decided to use the pcr technique to determine the role of h. pylori in tympanosclerosis. the biopsy samples of the middle ear mucosa of 31 ( 55.4% ) patients were h. pylori positive.
