five years later , the same group demonstrated that rassf1a does in fact negatively regulate cardiac hypertrophy in vivo using rassf1a mice. however , when rassf1a mice were challenged with pressure overload , they responded with an exaggerated hypertrophic response , evidenced by significantly greater increases in heart weight / body weight and hypertrophic gene expression ( anp , bnp , mhc ). cardiac myocytes of rassf1a mice were significantly larger , which explains the augmented heart growth. hemodynamic analysis of wt and rassf1a mice showed a rightward shift in pv loops following pressure overload in rassf1a hearts , yet dp / dtmax , dp / dtmin , and fractional shortening were not altered in rassf1a mice compared to wt. to examine rassf1a function in cardiac myocytes , oceandy et al. utilized a neonatal rat cardiac myocyte ( nrcm ) culture and the forced expression of rassf1a through adenoviral gene transfer. furthermore , treatment of rassf1a mice with a neutralizing antibody against tnf was able to rescue the augmented heart growth and fibrosis observed following pressure overload. rassf1a signaling is diverse and our knowledge regarding rassf1a function is rapidly expanding. chamber dilation of rassf1a mouse hearts was observed by echocardiography , consistent with eccentric hypertrophic remodeling.
