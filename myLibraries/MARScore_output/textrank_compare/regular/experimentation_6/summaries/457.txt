have a complex relationship with tumor cells ; at an early stage they attack tumor cells avoiding tumor spread ; however , over time they begin producing reciprocal growth factors and establish a symbiotic relationship with tumor cells. the infiltration of alveolar macrophages promotes the death of tumor cells in those sites of primary tumor growth and/or metastasis in lung. in lung cancer and in several types of cancers including breast , bladder , colon , pancreatic , and hematological cancers , blocking cd47 in tumor cells. nowadays , therapies are developed to block the interaction of tumor cells with macrophages through cd47 , thereby offering an opportunity to turn tams against nsclc cells by allowing the phagocytic behavior of resident macrophages. treatment with metformin is able to reduce the metastases in vivo , through blocked matrix metalloproteinase9 and expression of mmp2 , maintaining the components of the extracellular matrix , avoiding the separation of tumor cells , inhibiting the growth and metastasis of tumors. may reduce inflammation thereby preventing cancer , and blocking the antiphagocytic signal of cd47 on the surface of tumor cells can overcome immune suppression , harnessing the immune system to target malignant cells more effectively. the m2 macrophages have been found to encourage the growth of various tumour cells in vitro and to increase tumor cell survival [ 51 , 52 ].
