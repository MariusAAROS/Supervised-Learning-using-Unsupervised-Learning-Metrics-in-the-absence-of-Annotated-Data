the union of the predictions obtained with the four methods gives a set of likely membrane proteins , while the intersection contains those chains on whose annotation as membrane proteins all the predictors agree upon. the union of the predictions obtained with the four methods gives a set of likely membrane proteins , while the intersection contains those chains on whose annotation as membrane proteins all the predictors agree upon. automatic topology annotation for membrane proteins has been included among the efforts of the biosapiens european network of excellence ( ) with the specific aim of taking into consideration different predictors for annotating membrane proteins in the human genome. membrane proteins are difficult to study , since they are inserted into lipid bilayers and expose to the polar outer and inner environments portions of different sizes. are membrane proteins ( < 1% of the total number of structures and far less than their estimated abundance in cells ) there are a number of computational methods available to predict the topology of membrane proteins , which consists of two basic features : ( i ) the location of transmembrane domains along the protein chain and ( ii ) the location of the n and c termini with respect to the lipid membrane. conversely , pongo pred provides the user with a unique framework for membrane protein topology and signal peptide predictions.
