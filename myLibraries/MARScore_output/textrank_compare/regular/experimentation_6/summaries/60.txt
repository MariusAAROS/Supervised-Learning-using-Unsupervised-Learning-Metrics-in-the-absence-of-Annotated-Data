the potential advantages of cryopreservation of refractive lenticules have been largely described for use in the same patient , in the event of future ectasia or presbyopia by restoring corneal volume.3 with the increasing number of eyes undergoing relex smile for myopia , and thus , the extracted lenticules as a by product , it may be a novel idea to preserve these lenticules on a long term basis using cryopreservation for potential future use and research. the cryopreservation solution comprised 9 ml of tissue culture media ( cryobank wash media ) and 1 ml of 20% dimethyl sulfoxide ( dmso ). the cryopreservation solution comprised 9 ml of tissue culture media ( cryobank wash media ) and 1 ml of 20% dimethyl sulfoxide ( dmso ). using a liquid dropper , a stock freezing solution containing 10% human tissue culture medium and 20% dmso ( sigma aldrich , st louis , mo ). using a liquid dropper , a stock freezing solution containing 10% human tissue culture medium and 20% dmso ( sigma aldrich , st louis , mo ). was modified in this study by replacing bovine serum albumin with human tissue culture media to eliminate the risk of transmission of zoonotic diseases or unexpected adverse reactions due to bovine serum. the study was approved by the institutional ethics committee , and informed consent was obtained from all patients in accordance with the tenets of the declaration of helsinki.
