a stent is an appliance used for radiographic evaluation of height and width of the available bone during treatment planning for implant placement or during surgical procedures to provide site for optimum implant placement. on the other hand , the fixed type screw retained implant stents which are fabricated with the help of ct and cad / cam technology are very costly and require more time and laboratory procedures. later on , after applying the separating media over these regions and filling the undercuts with wax , transparent self curing material was applied at the teeth to be replaced along with some adjacent area antero posteriorly , which confers the stability to the stent during implant placement [ figure 5 ]. the efficacy of stents was then evaluated at the time of surgical exposure for implant placement and after the surgery , with the help of radiographs [ figures 7 , 8 ]. murat c cehreli suggested the fabrication of a bilaminar dual purpose stent that facilitates implant placement with improved verification of implant positioning. murat c cehreli suggested the fabrication of a bilaminar dual purpose stent that facilitates implant placement with improved verification of implant positioning. the possibility of displacement of stent during implant surgery was minimized by extension of the stent antero posteriorly to cover enough area over the teeth / tooth present adjacent to edentulous area.
