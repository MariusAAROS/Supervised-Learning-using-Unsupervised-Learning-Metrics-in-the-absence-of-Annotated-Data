the themes for the key informant interviews included hiv treatment seeking behaviour of the fsws , the challenges of enrolling into care , and the interventions to enhance linkage to hiv care in this population. only 58% of sex workers have access to hiv prevention and care programmes and less than half of hiv positive sex workers are enrolled into hiv care. however , while these barriers have been reported , there is still limited information on linkage to hiv care among sex workers in sub saharan africa , particularly on effective linkage models to inform scale up of hiv interventions among sex workers. although the program has over 200 fsws enrolled in hiv care , some of the fsws who tested hiv positive did not enrol for treatment. we conducted a study to identify the facilitators and barriers to linkage to hiv care among the fsws who tested positive in order to design appropriate hiv interventions for this key population group. this study was part of a larger study that explored the facilitators and barriers to linkage to hiv care among fsws in kampala and wakiso districts in central uganda. these included 14 fsws who were in hiv care and 14 who had not yet enrolled into care.
