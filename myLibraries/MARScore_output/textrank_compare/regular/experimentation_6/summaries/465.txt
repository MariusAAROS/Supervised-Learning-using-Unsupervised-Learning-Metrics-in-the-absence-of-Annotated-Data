the world health organization ( who ) data showed that each child practically has viral diarrhea irrespective of race and socioeconomic status within the first 5 years of life and this has great economic burden for the system of public health services and all society [ 2 , 3 ]. it also aimed at assessing the coinfection rates of the viral agents , age , seasonal distribution of infection , and the association between clinical symptoms and viral diarrhea. age group of 712 months had the highest prevalence of viral diarrhea with 48 ( 58.8% ). reports from nigeria have showed that viral diarrhea occurs throughout the year but with variations with respect to seasons [ 8 , 13 , 16 ]. viral diarrhea with respect to the two primary health centers did not show statistical significance ( p = 0.89 ) , as infection rates for evbomodu and aduwawa health centers were 43.0% and 42.1% , respectively. this finding is similar to other studies [ 2325 ] where vomiting was the most commonly associated symptom with viral diarrhea. thus , the differences in clinical symptoms with viral diarrhea as seen from the different studies may be attributed to seasonal variations , geographical location , nutritional status of the patients , and type of viral pathogens causing the infection.
