the negative finding in the control group could indicate that our paradigm did not produce evaluative conditioning effects. thus , it seems possible that evaluative conditioning effects in the control group were masked by the influence of outliers in our small sample. our result could also indicate that evaluative conditioning effects are stronger in dementia patients than in healthy elderly controls. nonetheless , patients with dementia might still be able to implicitly learn affective reactions through the process of evaluative conditioning. even though fear conditioning is impaired , evaluative conditioning might still be possible in dementia patients. thus , explicit knowledge about the cs ucs relation seems crucial in fear conditioning while evaluative conditioning can be demonstrated in the absence of contingency awareness [ 1012 ]. using the paper pencil version of this instrument , participants rated the stimuli as to their emotional valence ( range : 19 ).. similar to other studies investigating evaluative conditioning we used a cover story in order to minimize demand effects.
