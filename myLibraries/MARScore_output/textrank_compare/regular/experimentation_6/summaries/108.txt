in addition , txa has been reported to reduce blood loss and transfusion requirements during orthopedic surgery , most commonly in knee and hip joint replacement. thus , the aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of txa in controlling blood loss during clf for the treatment of mcsm. the 2 meta analyses arrived at a similar conclusion although the quantity of blood loss and incidence of blood transfusion were different. in this study , blood loss ( both intra and postoperative ) in the txa group was significantly lower than that in the control group , and no major intraoperative complications occurred. our results indicate that the use of intravenous txa is both safe and effective in reducing blood loss in clf. fibrinolysis increases transiently when patients undergo surgery , and it has been shown that it contributes to perioperative blood loss during spinal surgery. raksakietisak et al reported that 2 doses of txa ( 15 mg / kg ) reduced perioperative blood loss and incidence of blood transfusion among low risk adult patients undergoing elective complex thoracolumbar spine surgery.
