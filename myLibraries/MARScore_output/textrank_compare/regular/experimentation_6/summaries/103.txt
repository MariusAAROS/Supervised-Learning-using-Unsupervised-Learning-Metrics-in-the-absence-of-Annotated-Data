we propose that maldi tof is a rapid , accurate method for the identification of p. multocida from bacterial cultures and can significantly reduce the time to diagnosis of p. multocida bacteraemia. species identification of p. multocida was performed using traditional microbiological methods and confirmed with 16s rrna sequencing and matrix assisted laser desorption / ionization time of flight mass spectrometry ( maldi tof ). the blood culture set ( aerobic and anaerobic bottles ) taken on admission was positive with p. multocida but the abdominal swab grew only mixed anaerobes. laboratory isolation and identification of p. multocida was performed using standard microbiological techniques : api20ne , api20e ( biomerieux ) and the phoenix automated system ( bd ). interestingly , both api profiles reported a low confidence value for identification as p. multocida to the species level ( cv 53% ) and the phoenix assay only identified the isolate to genus level as pasteurella spp. the clinical isolate was identified as p. multocida with a confidence value of 2.321 indicating highly probable species identification , with no differential bacterial species being reported. have been identified and the species p. multocida can be further divided into three different subspecies ( subspecies multocida , septicum and gallicida ).
