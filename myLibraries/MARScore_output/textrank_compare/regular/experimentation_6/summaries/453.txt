recommendations for ebola virus contaminated wastewater disposal were met with debate ( e.g. , refs ( 1618 ) ) because of uncertainty about ebola virus persistence within wastewater matrices and the lack of a risk based analysis for waste handling. the necessity of evaluating ebola virus persistence in wastewater matrices has previously been highlighted , as wastewater in ebola virus outbreak settings may be temporarily held in open containers or disposed of in open sewers. the results of this study suggest a potential exposure route to infectious ebola virus via wastewater ; however , any assessment of potential exposure routes must consider the effects of wastewater composition , dilution of contaminated wastewater , and inactivation of ebola virus during treatment and holding. these results demonstrate a persistence of ebola virus in wastewater greater than what has previously been suggested and the potential of a wastewater exposure route to infectious ebola virus. ebola virus can be excreted in bodily fluids , including vomit , stool , blood , saliva , semen , and breast milk. ebola virus is considered a potential bioterrorism agent. initial recommendations were made on the basis of an expected limited persistence of ebola virus in the environment , as ebola virus is an enveloped virus , and a lack of strong evidence for a waterborne transmission route.
