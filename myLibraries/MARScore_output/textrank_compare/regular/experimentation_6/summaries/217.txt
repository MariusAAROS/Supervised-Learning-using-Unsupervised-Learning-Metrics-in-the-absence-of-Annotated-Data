this mode of constitutive secretion generates a constant pericellular atp cloud or halo which appears to be important in regulating intracellular calcium homeostasis following p2y receptor activation. beyond its role of cellular energy currency and phosphate donor , atp plays a potent signaling role through its extracellular release and activation of cell surface purinergic receptors. cell surface purinergic receptors are activated by this atp damp signal which serves to initiate an inflammatory response and promote wound healing. furthermore , such constitutive secretion leads to activation of cell surface gq coupled p2y receptors which elevate intracellular calcium levels through release of calcium. fast responses to atp are mediated through activation of p2x receptors , a family ( p2x1p2x7 ) of atp activated ligand gated ion channels and metabotropic effects through the activation of p2y receptors ( p2y12 , p2y4 , p2y6 , p2y1114 ) which couple to heterotrimeric g proteins. human leukocytes including monocytes , mast cells , neutrophils and central microglia express a diverse repertoire of p2y receptors though p2x1 , p2x4 and p2x7 are the dominant p2x subtypes present. activation of purinergic receptors in leukocytes is coupled to the production and secretion of cytokines and other pro inflammatory molecules including prostaglandin e2.
