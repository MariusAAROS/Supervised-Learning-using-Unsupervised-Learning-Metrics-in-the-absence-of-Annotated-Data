days 35 involved one solid meal per day , with 23 solid meals during days 57 , and the resumption of three solid food meals per day for 7 days following breaking of fast. as expected , body mass loss during fasting was severe and noticeable ( fig. resting metabolic rate ( 30 minutes by indirect calorimetry ) was 1626 kcal day. one prior report of long term fasting in obese individuals for 3040 days demonstrated body mass losses between 10.6% and 20.5% , but does not report on function of individuals.4 it seems self apparent and supported by this limited evidence , such that the starting mass is a key variable in survival of extreme fasting , and not the amount of loss. a 34year old male presented for general examination on day 49 of a 50day self imposed fast , seeking approval to continue his fasting behavior. history following the onset of fasting behavior was unremarkable , but included severe abdominal cramps between days 7 and 21 of fasting , development and frequent occurrence of vasovagal syncope on transition from sitting to standing , and the near cessation of fecal movement. it is noteworthy , therefore , in this case study that moderate physical function appears maintained at day 49 , as assessed by general observation and results of the six minute walk test. indeed , among the few ( nonpublished ) examples of complete fasting and mortality,5 patients were frail between 30 and 50 days , and death was noted to occur between days 43 and 70 , which this case study has reached without obvious or significant frailty occurring.
