thus the risk of biliary duct injury during the splitting procedure is usually considered higher than during living donor procedure. other authors have described the efficacy of biliary duct ablation by nbca in patients with persistent postsurgical bile leaks after lobectomy or cholecystectomy. the use of nbca in obliteration of a dilated bile duct seems to be a safe procedure with good results providing a less invasive option than hepatic resection above all in high risk patients with posttransplant bile duct injuries , decreasing the morbidity associated with chronic external biliary drainage. as a consequence of bile duct anatomic variations. split liver transplantation ( slt ) is an attractive alternative procedure to expand the donor pool in patients waiting for liver transplantation. the standard split liver procedure for a child and an adult ( adult / pediatric split liver ttransplantation , a / p slt ) , by splitting segment ii iii for pediatric recipient and segment i iv v vi vii viii for an adult , is an accepted surgical option with good results both for the adult and for pediatric recipient. biliary complications continue to be the major cause of morbidity after slt with a reported high incidence ranging between 10% and 32% [ 1 , 2 ].
