the baseline study demonstrated that the older cohort had significantly lower bmd at the femoral neck and lateral spine than age matched control subjects ( 7 ). study control subjects were community based and may not represent the general population of women. of the participants in the baseline study with diabetes , 87.5% ( 63 of 72 ) participated in this follow up study , and 93.4% ( 85 of 91 ) of control subjects participated in both examinations. participants 20 years of age with diabetes used oc therapy longer than control subjects ( p 0.05 ). women with diabetes , particularly the older women , continued to have higher bmi than control subjects. the percent increase in bmd from baseline to follow up was not statistically different between younger subjects and control subjects. in the adjusted model ( for age , bmi , and oc use ) , bmd values at the total hip ( baseline , p = 0.003 ; follow up , p = 0.007 ) and femoral neck ( baseline and follow up , p <. 0.001 ) were significantly lower in older women with diabetes compared with control subjects.
