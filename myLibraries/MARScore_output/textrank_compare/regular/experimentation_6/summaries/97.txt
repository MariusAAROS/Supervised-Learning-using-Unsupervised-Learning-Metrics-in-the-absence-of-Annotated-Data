mean sd fev1 value by stage was 88.6%9.3% in stage i , 60.4%8.1% in stage ii , 39.4%5.6% in stage iii , and 23.9%4.2% in stage iv. mean sd fev1 value by stage was 88.6%9.3% in stage i , 60.4%8.1% in stage ii , 39.4%5.6% in stage iii , and 23.9%4.2% in stage iv. a few recent studies have reported similar rates of adherence to guideline recommendations for copd patients ( 37.9%54.7% ) between pulmonologists in other countries.4,5 stage i patients were overtreated with regular long acting bronchodilators or combination of bronchodilators and icss , while guidelines recommend short acting bronchodilators as initial therapy. the distribution of patients on bronchodilator alone , treatment containing ics , and no maintenance drug by copd stage is shown in table 3. of all the patients , 614 ( 89% ) received treatment containing ics or ics alone. the distribution of patients on bronchodilator alone , treatment containing ics , and no maintenance drug by copd stage is shown in table 3. of all the patients , 614 ( 89% ) received treatment containing ics or ics alone. copd is characterized by persistent airway obstruction , usually of a progressive nature and associated with an enhanced chronic inflammatory response in airways to noxious particles or gases.1 copd is associated with increased mortality and reduced life expectancy.2 of the 3.8 million mortalities caused by chronic respiratory system diseases in 2010 , 2.9 million were by copd.3 the first consensus report for the diagnosis , management , and prevention of copd was published in 2001 by the global initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease ( gold ) committee , and since then it has been updated several times. the major objectives of gold are to increase the awareness of copd and to help the millions of people who suffer from this disease and die prematurely from it or its complications by increasing the standards of care.
