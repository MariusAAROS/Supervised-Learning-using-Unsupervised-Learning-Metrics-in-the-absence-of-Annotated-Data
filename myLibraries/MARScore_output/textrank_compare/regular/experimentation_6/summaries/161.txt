current studies have revealed the role of gene mutation in the proliferation of tumor cells. the fragment loss , point mutation , or methylation of p15 gene may all lead to its abnormal tumor suppressing function , thus facilitating the malignancy and metastasis of tumor cells. sp ihc staining was used to show the positive expression of tumors cells and metastatic conditions. sp ihc staining was used to show the positive expression of tumors cells and metastatic conditions. one week after the inoculation of tumor cells , there were small tumor lesions underneath the skin around the injection sites. on the first week , most of osteosarcoma and pulmonary tissues showed negative staining for tumor cells. one week after the inoculation of tumor cells , there were small tumor lesions underneath the skin around the injection sites.
