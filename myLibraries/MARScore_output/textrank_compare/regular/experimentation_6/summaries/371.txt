surgical parameters of the experimental group ( fusion levels = 137 ; pedicle screws = 269 ) and the control group ( fusion levels = 144 ; pedicle screws = 283 ) had no statistically significant variance. along with postero lateral fusion , additional interbody cages were used especially at very insufficient discs often seen in the caudal end of the construct. it is also said that ; more than 6 months of daily injection facilitates effective bone union following postero lateral fusion. they divide postero lateral fusion mass into 4 grades based on the appearance in an ap radiograph. animal studies yielded promising results for teriparatide usage to enhance postero lateral fusion mass in rat models. all of them had received multilevel lumbar fixation ( 3 levels or 4 vertebral segments ) with pedicle screw constructs and postero lateral intertransverse fusion with a combination of local bone graft and allograft. the union rate and hardware related complications remain a major concern in these patients , especially following multilevel spinal fusion surgeries.
