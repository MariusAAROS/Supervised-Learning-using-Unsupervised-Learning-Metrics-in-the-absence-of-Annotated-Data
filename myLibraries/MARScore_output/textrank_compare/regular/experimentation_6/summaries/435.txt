recent studies have shown that interactions between inflammatory cells and retinal cells are critical for the development of intraocular neovascularization [ 1012 ]. but there was no significant change in the lbi pretreated group ( 29244.6 2981.2 in controls ; 5787.7 4126.4 with cocl2 ; and 27189.0 11231.1 with cocl2 after lbi pretreatment ; p < 0.05 , nonrepeated anova , n = 5 , figure 1(e ) ). because disruption of tjs is detected as a decrease of signal intensity , these results indicate that lbi pretreatment can protect the tjs of the outer brb from hypoxic stress. because lbi pretreatment protected the conformation of the tj proteins from hypoxic stress , we hypothesized that lbi will block different inflammatory molecules that are secreted from cells during hypoxia. the results of the elisa measurements of the conditioned culture media ( n = 5 ) indicated that il8 was not significantly changed after the addition of cocl2 or after pretreatment with lbi ( control , 6.9 0.1 ; with cocl2 , 6.8 0.1 ; and with cocl2 after lbi pretreatment , 6.9 0.1 pg / ml ; figure 2(a ) ). although the level of il6 was increased after addition of cocl2 which was decreased by lbi pretreatment , these changes were not significant ( control , 10.4 1.6 ; cocl2 addition , 15.0 6.7 ; and cocl2 addition after lbi pretreatment , 13.3 7.6 pg / ml ; figure 2(b ) ). the level of mcp1 increased significantly after the addition of cocl2 , and it was significantly decreased after the addition of cocl2 after lbi pretreatment ( control , 279.7 68.3 ; with cocl2 , 340.8 43.3 ; and with cocl2 after lbi pretreatment , 182.6 23.8 pg / ml , p < 0.05 ; nonrepeated anova ; figure 2(c ) ).
