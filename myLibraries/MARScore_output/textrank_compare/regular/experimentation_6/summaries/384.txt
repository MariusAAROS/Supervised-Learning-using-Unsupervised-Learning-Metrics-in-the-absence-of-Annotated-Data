ilm peeling was reported to increase anatomical success and prevent reopening of the hole by decreasing erm development.25,26 besides reports that suggest that ilm peeling increases anatomical success but not functional success,27 there are also reports that suggest functional outcomes are better in ilm peeling groups.18 in this study , ilm peeling was applied to all patients who underwent macular hole surgery. cataract development is the most prevalent complication of macular hole surgery in phakic eyes. early cataract surgery following macular hole surgery may increase the risk of re opening of the hole,28 there are also studies that report no such risk.29,30 therefore , in patients developing cataract , phacoemulsification surgery was performed at least 6 months after macular hole surgery to prevent a recurrence. since icg was first introduced for ilm peeling in macular hole surgery , several potential side effects have been noted.37,38 visual field defects , retinal pigment epithelium , and ganglion cell defects are among the most reported side effects.26,32,33 dose dependent biochemical damage to the retinal pigment epithelium and ganglion cells , photo oxidative cell damage due to the phototoxic properties of icg , and retinal pigment epithelium damage due to hypoosmotic solution are considered responsible for icg mediated ocular toxicity.3941 because of the potential toxic side effects of icg in chromovitrectomy , other vital dyes with minimal toxicity have been tried.32,33,38,42 ifcg , unlike icg , does not contain iodine , and it is widely thought that its toxicity to the retinal pigment epithelium is less than that of icg.31 triamcinolone acetonide was reported as both toxic4345 and nontoxic46 to retinal pigment epithelium in preclinical studies. ilm peeling in macular hole surgery provides beneficial effects on anatomical outcome , independent of disease stage. anatomical and functional outcomes of macular hole patients who underwent 23 g ppv and ilm peeling with bb were evaluated. vitreoretinal interface changes due to cellular proliferation lead to ilm distortion and eventually to the development of epiretinal membrane ( erm ) , macular hole , and recurring macular edema.9 with the removal of the ilm , successful results may be obtained in surgical treatment of such vitreoretinal diseases.
