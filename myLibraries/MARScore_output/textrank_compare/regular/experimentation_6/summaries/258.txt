1. 1,3diazabutadiene ligands , from which diazaethene ligands are often prepared , are increasingly important within coordination chemistry due to their flexible coordination modes and redox properties. here , the zinc atom is chelated symmetrically [ zn n bond distances 1.957(2 ) and 1.971(2 ) ] although metal hydride complexes are notoriously insoluble , a reputation perpetuated by common hydride reagents such as lih and cah2 , the hydride carrier 7 is soluble in the nonpolar solvent hexane. the largest deviation between the calculated and experimental values occurs for the interactions involving the hydride ion ( e.g. , zn h : 1.94 calculated vs. 2.14 experimental , see table s1 in supporting information for details ). the field of utility organometallics is increasingly turning to more complex mixed metal systems to deliver superior results , whether this be for metal halogen exchange , alkylation , insertion , or the trapping of reactive intermediates. in theory. , mixed metal reagents can offer more flexible , tunable solutions to any problem compared to more traditional monometallic alternatives due to the increased number of components which can be varied.
