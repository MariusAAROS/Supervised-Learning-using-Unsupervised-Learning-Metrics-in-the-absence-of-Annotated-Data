this can lead to intestinal obstruction , ischemic bowel secondary to vascular compression and hydronephrosis due to ureteric compression. histological examination of the resected specimen from the first laporotomy revealed mesenteric fibromatosis ( desmoid tumour ) incompletely excised. histological examination of the resected specimen from the first laporotomy revealed mesenteric fibromatosis ( desmoid tumour ) incompletely excised. desmoid tumours ( fibromatosis ) are benign fibrous neoplasms originating from the musculo aponeurotic structures throughout the body. desmoid tumours can arise from any skeletal muscle but commonly affect the rectus abdominus in post partum females and in old surgical scars of the abdomen. desmoid tumours originate from the musculo aponeurotic structures of the body and can be peripheral or intra abdominal. biallelic mutations of the apc gene induces desmoid tumour formation , hence the association between these two disorders ( 8).
