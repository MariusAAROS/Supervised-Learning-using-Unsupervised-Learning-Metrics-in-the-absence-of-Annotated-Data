dermal homing of t. pallidum on immunohistochemistry : ( a ) multiple interstitial clumps of spirochetes ( 200 ) ; ( b ) vascular trapping of spirochetes ( 400 ) ; ( c ) prominent accumulation of spirochetes in the microvasculature wall ( 400 ). dermal homing of t. pallidum on immunohistochemistry : ( a ) multiple interstitial clumps of spirochetes ( 200 ) ; ( b ) vascular trapping of spirochetes ( 400 ) ; ( c ) prominent accumulation of spirochetes in the microvasculature wall ( 400 ). in the present case , skin immunohistochemistry shed some light on the diagnosis of syphilis in an aids patient and showed the dermal homing and the microvascular tropism of t. pallidum. it is acknowledged that during a five year period after inoculation , t. pallidum spreads to every organ. immunohistochemistry using an antibody directed to t. pallidum was reported to improve the histological diagnostic accuracy of syphilis. the present finding was assumed to illustrate the migration of t. pallidum toward the microvasculature during early syphilis. in summary , t. pallidum were abundant and heavily clustered in some specific portions of the skin.
