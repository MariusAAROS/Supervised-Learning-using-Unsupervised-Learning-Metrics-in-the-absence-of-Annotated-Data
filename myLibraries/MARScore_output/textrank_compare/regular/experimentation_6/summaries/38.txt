although tb was recently regarded primarily as a disease of the developing countries it is now also on the increase in developed countries such as the united kingdom , mainly as a result of globalisation as well as an increase in immunosuppressed patients. following the diagnosis of tb , the patient recalled that in her former post as a nursing assistant , when she was much younger , she was exposed to patients with tb. extra spinal tuberculous osteomyelitis is rare and comprises about 2 3% of all cases of osteoarticular tuberculosis , with the hip and knee joints being the most common following spinal involvement ( 3 ). the infection could have been contracted at a much younger age , when she was caring for patients infected with tuberculosis , and remained latent. figures by the health protection agency ( hpa ) show that the cases of tb in the uk increased by 5.5% in 2009 when compared to those in 2008 ( 2 ). although improvements in its management and treatment are continuously occurring an estimated 1.8 million people died of tb in 2008 ( 1 ). a high index of suspicion of tb is important to obtain the correct diagnosis.
