bipolar hip arthroplasty using tight fitting cup for avn hip has a low incidence of groin pain , acetabular erosion , and revision in midterm followup. the femoral component subsidence was evaluated by measuring the distance between the superior margin of the greater trochanter and the shoulder of the stem.3 medial migration of the bipolar cup was determined from the distance between a line perpendicular to kohler 's line and center of the outer head , whereas superior migration was indicated by a change in distance between the inter teardrop line and the centre of outer head means centre of the circle that is calculated from the circumference of outer cup of bipolar prosthesis that is easily outlined on the radiograph.3 all radiographic measurements were done by either of two authors on ap radiograph of the hip and were compared to the immediate postoperative radiographs. the femoral component subsidence was evaluated by measuring the distance between the superior margin of the greater trochanter and the shoulder of the stem.3 medial migration of the bipolar cup was determined from the distance between a line perpendicular to kohler 's line and center of the outer head , whereas superior migration was indicated by a change in distance between the inter teardrop line and the centre of outer head means centre of the circle that is calculated from the circumference of outer cup of bipolar prosthesis that is easily outlined on the radiograph.3 all radiographic measurements were done by either of two authors on ap radiograph of the hip and were compared to the immediate postoperative radiographs. surgical treatment of avascular necrosis ( avn ) of head of femur include core decompression , osteotomies , nonvascularized bone grafting , free vascularized fibular grafts , hip resurfacing , bipolar hip arthroplasty ( bha ) and total hip arthroplasty ( tha).123 tha is indicated in the young individual in avn with acetabular involvement ; however , its role is unclear in cases without acetabular involvement.4 bha was initially limited to be used in hip osteoarthritis , nonunions and acute neck femur fractures.56 bateman7 and giliberty8 were first to use bha in ficat stage 3 avn based on the hypothesis that. also showing implant in situ ( b ) 4 years postoperative radiograph of the same patient treated with bipolar hip arthroplasty. ( c ) 16 years followup radiograph of the same patient without any loosening or migration and with subchondral sclerosis ( a ) x ray pelvis with both hip joints anteroposterior view in a 40 year old male showing avascular necrosis ficat stage iii in right hip ( post alcoholic ) ( b ) x ray of right hip joint anteroposterior view of same patient showing implant in position at 9 years followup without any sign of erosion or migration. acetabular floor retains a regenerative property , which regenerates bone in the subchondral region , if stimulation in the form of weight bearing is given through an accurately fitted cup and theorized that preferential motion at inner bearing will decrease the cartilage erosion.
