post translational degradation of stat2 protein by hpiv2 v protein was blocked by proteasome inhibitors indicating a role for proteasomal degradation. transgenic mice expressing human stat2 restores the ability of piv5 v protein to mediated degradation of stat1. likewise , expression of human stat2 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts permits antagonism of endogenous murine ifn/ signaling by both piv5 and hpiv2 v proteins. ns5 interaction with human stat2 was mapped to the coiled coil domain of human stat2 containing a species specific sequence between residues 181301. however , human stat2 , while being relatively well conserved with macaque and chimpanzee , diverges significantly when paired with mouse , rat , horse and elephant. the sequences of stat2 from the indicated species were aligned beginning with residue 651 of human stat2. demonstrated that while the c terminus of mouse was significantly different than human , cbp could still interact with the c terminus of both mouse and human stat2 and functionally cooperate to regulate transcription.
