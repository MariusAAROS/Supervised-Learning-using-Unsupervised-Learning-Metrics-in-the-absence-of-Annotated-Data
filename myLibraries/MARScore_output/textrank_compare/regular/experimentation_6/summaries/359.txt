( b ) accumulation of blood in lower esophagus in venous phase ( yellow arrow head ). weiss tear without active bleeding along with the presence of large blood clots in the gastric fundus. owing to the increasing number of interventions of the aorta , secondary aef is 10 times more common than primary. we present a case of aef which was initially treated as variceal bleeding and later promptly diagnosed with computed tomography ( ct ). upper gastrointestinal bleeding ( ugib ) is a major cause of mortality and morbidity accounting for about 56.5/100,000 hospitalization with a mortality rate of 8.2%. aorto esophageal fistula ( aef ) , an abnormal anatomical communication between the aorta and esophagus is a rare cause of ugib. as the thoracic aneurysm grows in size , the increasing tension on its wall will erode the aorta and rupture into the surrounding esophagus leading to uncontrolled bleeding.
