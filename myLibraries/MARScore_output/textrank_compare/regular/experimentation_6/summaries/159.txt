the prevalence of maternal overweight was similar in children with incomplete data and in children with complete data ( 24.1% and 26.1% , resp. ). our findings on screen time and overweight risk are also in line with the results of a comprehensive meta analysis on the subject , which observed a statistically significant relationship between tv viewing and body fatness among children and youth.. specific dietary habits and ( in)activities associated with overweight risk in specific age groups need to be identified and their quantitative contribution to the overweight prevalence in the population needs to be assessed. for the multiple imputation we used all the data that were used in the analyses , as well as data on the children 's weight and height that were measured and reported by the parents in the yearly questionnaires.. maternal education and maternal overweight could be confounders of the associations studied but could also be factors in causal pathways. in addition , the analyses were repeated , stratified for maternal education , maternal overweight and gender. the association between maternal overweight and overweight in the child weakened only marginally in the model including behavioral risk factors ( 5% change in regression coefficient from 1.07 to 1.02 ) , indicating that the association between maternal overweight and overweight of the child is only to a limited extent mediated by the behavioral factors studied ( see table 2 , model 4 ). the analyses were repeated after stratification for low maternal education , maternal overweight and gender , respectively.
