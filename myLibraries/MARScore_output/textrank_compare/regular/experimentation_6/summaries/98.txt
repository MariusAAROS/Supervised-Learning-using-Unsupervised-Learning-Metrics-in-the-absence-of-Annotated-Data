inadequate statistical power resulting from the relatively small sample size and the relatively low incidence of amb nephrotoxicity due to the administration of liposomal amb appear to be the main reasons for our findings in this regard. although it is a common event in clinical settings , different aspects of amb nephrotoxicity have not been studied well or in detail in our population. the purpose of this investigation was to specifically assess the frequency , time onset , and possible associated factors of amb nephrotoxicity in hospitalized patients in hematology oncology wards in the southwest of iran. they included age , sex , weight , amb dose , duration and indication , duration of amb infusion , type of co administered medications that may exacerbate or attenuate amb nephrotoxicity , length of hospital stay , and mortality. because most cases of amb nephrotoxicity occur during the first 2 weeks of treatment ( 9 , 10 ) , urine urea , creatinine , sodium , potassium , and magnesium levels were determined at days 0 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 10 , and 14 of the amb treatment. amb nephrotoxicity was defined as an estimated clcr 50% ( calculated by the cockcroft gault formula ) or an increase in serum creatinine ( double the baseline value ) ( 11 ). daily dose reductions , every other day dosing , discontinuation , or performing dialysis as probable measures of managing amb nephrotoxicity were recorded.
