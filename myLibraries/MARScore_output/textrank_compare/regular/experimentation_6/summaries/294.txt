the statistical significance of 3 mg / kg of n f5ht treatment was determined only for bwc. it is noteworthy that n f5ht treatment resulted in a significant decrease of il1 level in plasma ( aa n f5ht versus aa , p < 0.05 ; figure 1(a ) ). the significant increase of bwc in n f5ht treated rats , probably sign of the partial improvement of rheumatoid cachexia , might be the result of lowered mrna expression of tnf and il1 determined in the arthritic liver. n f5ht treatment led to a significant increase of bwc on day 28 ( aa n f5ht versus aa , p < 0.05 ; table 3 ). n f5ht treatment led to amelioration of inflammatory parameters tested ( plasmatic crp and il1 protein levels , liver lox activity , and liver and spleen cytokine expression ). in the spleen of n f5ht treated rats , the relative mrna expression decreased even to control level. n feruloylserotonin ( n f5ht , n feruloyl5hydroxy tryptamine ) is a conjugated serotonin , a member of the indole hydroxycinnamic acid amides , with serotonin ( 5ht ) and ferulic acid ( fa ) as representative components of its structure.
