a grading system of lyg is based on the number of atypical lymphocytes , ebv positive b cells and amount of necrosis5 ). immunohistoche mical staining for cd3 and cd20 showed the predominance of mature t cells and atypical b cells ( fig. in this case , immunohistochemical staining for cd3 and cd20 showed the predominance of mature t cells and atypical b cells. grade iii lesions , angiocentric lymphomas , consisted of large atypical cells with more than twenty ebv positive cells in high power field with the marked cytologic atypia in both small and large lymphoid cells4,13 ). large lymphoid cells or immunoblasts were less than five in high power field ( 400 ) or absent. if large lymphoid cells or immunoblasts were present , there would be no cellular atypia and minimal to absent necrosis. grade ii lesions consisted of large lymphoid cells with less than twenty ebv positive cells in high power field with some cellular atypia in small lymphoid cells , and necrosis was more common.
