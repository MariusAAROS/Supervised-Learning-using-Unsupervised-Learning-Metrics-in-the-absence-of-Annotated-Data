according to behnam et al. , c. albicans and c. dubliniensis strains were maintained on sabouraud dextrose agar ( difco ) plates. the antifungal activities of the eo against 25 standard strains of fungi , including c. albicans ( atcc 5982 , 1912 , 562 , 1905 , 1949 , 10261 , and 2730 ) , c. tropicalis ( atcc 750 ) , c. krusei ( atcc 6258 ) , c. glabrata ( atcc 863 , 2192 , 2175 , 6144 , and 90030 ) , c. dubliniensis ( cbs 8501 , atcc 8500 , 7987 , and 7988 ) , c. parapsilosis ( atcc 4344 ) , c. neoformance ( atcc 9011 ) , aspergillus flavus ( atcc 64025 ) , a. fumigatus ( atcc 14110 , cbs 144.89 ) , a. clavatus ( cbs 514.65 ) , and a. oryzae ( cbs 818.72 ) were determined. as shown in table 4 , the eo completely inhibited the biofilm formation of c. albicans and c. dubliniensis at concentrations of 1 l / ml and 2 l / ml , respectively.. the compositions of the eos might be affected by the developmental stages of the plant. in addition , m. piperita eo has been shown to cause inhibitory effects against radial fungal growth and aflatoxin production by aspergillus species. the antifungal activities of m. piperita eo against the tested yeasts are shown in table 2. all of the aspergillus standard strains were susceptible to m. piperita eo at concentrations of 0.54 l / ml ( table 3 ). although some authors reported alpha terpinen as the dominant component of m. piperita eo ( 19.7% ) , similar to the previous studies [ 4 , 7 , 33 ] , we identified menthol as one of the main constituents of the eos.
