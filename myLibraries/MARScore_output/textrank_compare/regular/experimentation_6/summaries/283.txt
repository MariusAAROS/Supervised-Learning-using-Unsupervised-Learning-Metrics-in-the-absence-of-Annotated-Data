after a consensus meeting between three radiologists who were unaware of the clinical results after tfesi , we selected those cases treated by conventional tfesi with supra adjacent nerve root impingement. after a consensus meeting between three radiologists who were unaware of the clinical results after tfesi , we selected those cases treated by conventional tfesi with supra adjacent nerve root impingement. in conclusion , preganglionic tfesi was found to have a better therapeutic effect on the radiculopathy caused by compression at the supra adjacent level than did conventional tfesi , and this result had borderline statistical significance. the level and cause of nerve root compression on the ct or mr imaging and the level of radiculopathy were documented in the medical charts before performing tfesi. the level and cause of nerve root compression on the ct or mr imaging and the level of radiculopathy were documented in the medical charts before performing tfesi. thus , performing preganglionic tfesi at the supra adjacent level may be a more effective method to deliver injectate to a target site. ( 6 ) inserted the needle into the inferior and anterior neural foramen for performing preganglionic tfesi , and we use a modification of this method.
