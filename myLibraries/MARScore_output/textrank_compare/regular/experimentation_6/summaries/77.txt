several reports have suggested that rage and amphoterin are closely associated with invasion and metastasis in cancer cells [ 26 , 27 ]. both oxidative stress and tgf are key regulators of the malignancy rather than the proliferation of cancer cells [ 3335 ]. rage proteins of different molecular weights were detected in a549 cells ( figure 1 ). we examined the effect of glycer ages on the cell viability of a549 cells. indeed , full length rage ( 57 kda ) was detected in a549 cells. glycer ages induced the invasion of a549 cells across matrigel , indicating that matrix degradation and migration mechanisms had been stimulated in these cells. tgf strongly induces mmp2 expression in a549 cells ; however , mrna expression of tgf was not induced by glycer ages , and the mrna levels of mmp2 , which is produced by tgf , did not change.
