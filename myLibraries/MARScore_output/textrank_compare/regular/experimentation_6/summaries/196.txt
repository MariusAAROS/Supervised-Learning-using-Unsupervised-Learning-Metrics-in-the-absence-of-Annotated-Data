although open colorectal resection has been practiced for many years in kidney recipient patients , the minimally invasive procedure has been developed and is gaining popularity. therefore , minimally invasive colorectal procedures could be considered safe alternatives to open colorectal resection in selected kidney transplant patients. kidney transplant recipients not only have numerous comorbidities associated with renal failure , but also often have additional problems due to chronic immunosuppression [ 13 ]. the aim of this study was to prove the safety and feasibility of laparoscopic and robotic colorectal resection in kidney transplant recipients by evaluating the technical protocol and the short and long term outcomes. the reported incidence of colorectal cancer in kidney transplant recipients has ranged from 0 to 0.9%. in conclusion , minimally invasive surgery is feasible in kidney transplant recipients , who can benefit from fewer wound related problems. however , any port position even in totally robotic technique could be safe as long as the ports are placed away from transplanted kidney.
