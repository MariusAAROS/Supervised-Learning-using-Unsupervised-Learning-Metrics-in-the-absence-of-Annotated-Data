the risk of congenital infection is much higher during primary infection [ 25 ] , when the rate of transmission from mother to fetus is 30%40% [ 1 , 6 ] , as against 0.15%2.2% during reactivations or reinfections [ 1 , 69 ] when , furthermore , most of the newborns are asymptomatic. contact with the urine or saliva of their children is a major source of infection [ 2527 ].. the incidence of primary infection among pregnant women ranges from 0.5% and 4% [ 28 , 29 ] ; the rate of seroconversion during pregnancy ranges from 0.4% to 2% [ 12 , 13 , 30 , 31 ] and depends on the seroprevalence of the infection in the population , being 3.7% among women belonging to populations with a low seroprevalence ( 55% ) and 1.0%1.6% among those belonging to populations with a high seroprevalence ( 85% ). there were also calculated the density incidence as cases / pregnant woman trimester and the correlated risk for all women ( seronegative and seropositive ) : they were , respectively , 0.8% ( 95% ci : 0.471.13 ) and 0.4% ( 95% ci : 0.170.63 ). the aim of this study was to assess the incidence and risk of acquiring cmv infection in pregnant women in an urban area in northern italy in the period 20052007. the cumulative incidence of cmv infection ( new cases observed during pregnancy ) calculated on the basis of the 13 cases with low or moderate igg avidity was 1.4% ( 95% ci : 0.971.83 ) , and the risk of infection during pregnancy , calculated on the basis of all of the women ( seronegative and seropositive ) , was 0.5 100 pregnancies ( 95% ci : 0.240.76 ). moreover , in this study 95% of the women had an age between 21 and 40 years while age classes of 20 or less than 20 and over 40 years were under represented ; so this could be a further cause of the lack of difference in seroprevalence.. on the basis of the results of the igg avidity test , the cumulative incidence of cmv infection was 1.4% ( 95% ci : 0.971.83% ) , the density incidence was 0.8% ( 95% ci : 0.471.13 ) , and the risk of infection was 0.5% ( 95% ci : 0.240.76% ) without any significant differences by age.. seroconversion or clinical data indicating acute infection were available for three of the five cases with moderate avidity in this study , thus moderate avidity was considered as a potential marker of acute infection. the incidence and risk of cmv infection in pregnancy found in our area , therefore , support the use of serological screening , certainly in the first trimester when the risk of infection is higher and , in the case of seronegative women , possibly also one screening in the second trimester and one in the third.
