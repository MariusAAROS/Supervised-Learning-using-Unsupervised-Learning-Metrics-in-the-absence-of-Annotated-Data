we observed that the number of p mtor positive neurons was significantly increased in the rvm on day 7 after sni compared to the sham group ( figures 2(a ) , 2(d ) , and 2(f ) ) , indicating that activation of mtor in the rvm may contribute to sni induced neuropathic pain. double immunofluorescence staining for p mtor / neun , p mtor / fg , or p mtor/5ht was performed. the same counting method was used to evaluate the coexpression of 5ht / p mtor as well as that of p mtor / fg within the rvm. cells with visible green cytoplasmic staining represent 5htergic or fg labeled cells , while red staining represents p mtor positive cells ; thus , cells with 5ht or fg double labeling with p mtor appear yellow. , we found that the activated form of mtor , p mtor , was expressed in the rvm , and it was exclusively expressed by neurons based on the observation that p mtor was almost completely colocalized with neun , a marker for neurons , in rats in both the sham ( figures 2(a)2(c ) ) and post sni day 7 groups ( figures 2(d)2(f ) ). as indicated in figure 2(h ) , p mtor and p s6k were significantly elevated in the rvm 3 days after sni , and phosphorylation was maintained for at least 14 days compared to the control group ( figures 2(h ) and 2(i ) ; p mtor : sni d3 : 1.42 0.25 ; sni d7 : 1.86 0.39 ; sni d14 : 1.49 0.28fold of naive control , p < 0.05 ; p s6k : sni d3 : 1.75 0.23 ; sni d7 : 1.96 0.57 ; sni d14 : 1.61 0.28fold of nave control , p. < the change in p s6k was similar to that in p mtor , indicating that the mtor signaling pathway in the rvm was activated by sni 3 days after surgery.
