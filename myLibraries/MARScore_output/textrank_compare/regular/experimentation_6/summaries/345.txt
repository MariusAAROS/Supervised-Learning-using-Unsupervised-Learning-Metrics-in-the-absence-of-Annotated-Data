in epidural analgesia during delivery , a motor block is unwanted , and thus voluntary muscle movements are possible , which makes longstanding external compression of nerves uncommon. a diagnosis of bilateral neuropathy of the medial calcaneal nerve , most likely due to longstanding pressure on both heels with epidural analgesia as a predisposing factor , was made. bilateral neuropathy of the medial calcaneal nerve due to external compression during delivery using epidural analgesia is very rare. however , also without any risk factors , the clinician should be aware of the absence of the normal reaction to longstanding pressure on a nerve during epidural analgesia. bilateral medial calcaneal nerve neuropathy as a result of external compression is a rare complication of epidural obstetric analgesia. nerve injuries are more likely to occur in nulliparae , in cases of prolonged stages of labour and assisted vaginal deliveries. with an incidence rate of 0.92% , maternal puerperal lower extremity nerve injuries are rare.
