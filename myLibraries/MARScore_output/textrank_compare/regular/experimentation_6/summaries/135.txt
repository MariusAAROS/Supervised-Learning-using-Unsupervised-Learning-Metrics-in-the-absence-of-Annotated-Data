the cleavage stages of morulae and blastocysts or the symmetry and patterns of cell division are also notable and frequently used aspects , and are often examined during the prediction of embryo viability ( 23 ). metabolomic , ( proteomic ) profiling of spent embryo culture ( sec ) offers an exceptional , non invasive opportunity for the assessment of embryo viability ( 30,31 ). more complicated is the concept when unknown , new biomarker molecules of embryo viability are searched for , assuming that these biomarkers were secreted by the embryo. in parallel to the spreading of mass spectrometry , proteomics is also an emerging field in the understanding of embryo development ( 39,40 ). during the first three days of embryo development the formation of a subunit ( alfa1 ) of the human haptoglobin molecule was observed. to overcome the different practice of laboratories worldwide in 2011 an international consensus ( istanbul consensus ) has been reached on embryo viability assessment ( 27 ).. some authors reported that the identification of these parameters resulted in successful prediction of embryo implantation potential , but other research groups describe contradictory results ( 34 , 35 ).
