blank et al. defined breast cancer , cervical cancer , and b cell lymphoma as the most common malignancies in patients with sarcoidosis.. a very recent retrospective study described the clinical biological and radiological characteristics of 12 patients presenting sarcoidosis associated with solid tumor ; sarcoidosis frequently affects patients with breast cancer ( 32.3% ) and thus must be considered in the differential diagnosis of the disease. this case report emphasizes the importance of differential diagnosis of lymph node involvement in cancer patients. the suspected diagnosis was breast cancer at t 1n 3 cm 0. the molecular type of breast cancer was identified as non luminal her2/neu positive through immunohistochemistry. therefore , the post operative diagnosis of the patient was left breast cancer ( t 1n 0 m 0 ) , with sarcoidosis of left axillary and right supraclavicular lymph nodes. reported 21 cases of sarcoidosis developing after primary malignancies , including 10 cases after breast cancer.
