in one case series , the mean time from the diagnosis of thyroid tumor until discovery of skull metastasis was 23.3 years ( 8). prognosis in case of metastasis is generally poor and the 10year survival with bone metastases from dtc is reported to be 27% ( 7 ). skull metastases are uncommon with recent decline in incidence because of early detection and treatment of thyroid cancer ; among thyroid carcinomas , these metastases tend to occur more commonly in ftc and have a female preponderance ( 68 ). there were only 12 reported cases of skull metastases out of 473 patients of thyroid cancer in one study , accounting for 2.5% of cases ( 8). skull metastases from ftc most commonly present as a slow growing soft , painless usually hemispheric and singular lump in the occipital region ( 6 , 7 , 12 ). however , mean survival time of 4.5 years was reported with skull metastases in one case series , suggesting even worse prognosis and warranting an aggressive and multidisciplinary approach in this subset of patients ( 5 ). bone metastases from ftc tend to be multiple and often involve sternum , ribs , and vertebrae ( 3 ). bone metastases uncommonly respond to radioactive iodine therapy and are associated with poor prognosis ( 7 ).
