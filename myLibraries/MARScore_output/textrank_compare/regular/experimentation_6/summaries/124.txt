after the addition of cu2o / rgo ( 0.5 g ) into co2saturated water ( 10 ml ) , the septum sealed reactor was purged by ar gas for 10 min. the sample was irradiated with a 150 w xe lamp for 30 min , and then 0.5 ml of the reaction product taken from the vessel headspace was analyzed by gc. graphene oxide ( go ) solution was synthesized from natural graphite powder by a modification of hummers method.45 cu2o / rgo composites were fabricated by a microwave assisted hydrothermal reaction. after the addition of cu2o / rgo ( 0.5 g ) into co2saturated water ( 10 ml ) , the septum sealed reactor was purged by ar gas for 10 min. the sample was irradiated with a 150 w xe lamp for 30 min , and then 0.5 ml of the reaction product taken from the vessel headspace was analyzed by gc. were also synthesized , which include cu2o/0.25 % rgo , cu2o/0.5 % rgo , and cu2o/1 % rgo , in which x % represents the calculated weight ratio of the go added to cu2o. were also synthesized , which include cu2o/0.25 % rgo , cu2o/0.5 % rgo , and cu2o/1 % rgo , in which x % represents the calculated weight ratio of the go added to cu2o. for optimization , cu2o / rgo composites with different amounts of rgo. the homogeneous solution was heated with stirring in the microwave system at 150 c for 3 h. after the product was cooled to rt , the final product was collected by centrifugation , washed with water five times , and dried at 70 c. blank cu2o was synthesized through the same procedure , except for the addition of go solution. photocatalysts were treated at 200 c for 3 h in a tubular furnace under the protection of ar or in air ( denoted cu2o treated in ar or air ).
