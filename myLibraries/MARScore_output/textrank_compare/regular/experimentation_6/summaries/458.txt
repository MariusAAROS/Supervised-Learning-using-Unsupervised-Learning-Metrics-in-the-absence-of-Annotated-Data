we investigated to evaluate whether biochemical response using serial plasma cga is reliable in concordance with the tumor response based on response evaluation criteria in solid tumors ( recist ) criteria in gep nets irrespective of chemotherapeutic agents. however , it is still controversial whether serial cga changes reflect tumor response for treatment. this study showed that the change of the cga level was correlated with tumor response in nonfunctioning gepnets. , there were no definite measuring criteria of plasma cga for tumor response and conflicting result of sensitivity and specificity in accordance to treatment response were reported in the literature. biochemical efficacy was estimated according to the criteria proposed by the italian trials in medical oncology ( itmo ) group for evaluating markers ( biochemical response ). biochemical efficacy was estimated according to the criteria proposed by the italian trials in medical oncology ( itmo ) group for evaluating markers ( biochemical response ). additionally , biochemical response based on serial cga may be a predictive marker for pfs in gep nets.
