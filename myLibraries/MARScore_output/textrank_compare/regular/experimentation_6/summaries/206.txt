staining of chitin and glucan in walls of cells grown with 0.4% ba revealed a buildup of cell wall material at bud necks , particularly in cell chains ( figure 2 ). we propose that at concentrations below the mic where the impact on growth is measurable but weak , boric acid stress reduces cell wall synthesis activity along with other metabolic activities. the present study was undertaken to assess the effect of ba on morphogenesis and cell wall synthesis in yeast , using the well established model organism saccharomyces cerevisiae as a study subject.. in s. cerevisiae , morphogenesis and cell wall synthesis depend on the correct assembly of cytoskeletal proteins. to guide cell wall synthesis during cytokinesis , a ring of septin filaments forms during the g1 phase of the cell cycle and. the septa formed under these conditions do not allow for the separation of cells after cytokinesis , leading to the formation of chains and clumps of misshaped cells. viability staining of yeast cultures was performed by incubating cells in 0.2 mg / ml methylene blue in 50 mm kh2po4 for 5 minutes at rt. cells were washed and incubated for 5 minutes in 0.01% calcofluor white or 0.5% aniline blue , respectively.
