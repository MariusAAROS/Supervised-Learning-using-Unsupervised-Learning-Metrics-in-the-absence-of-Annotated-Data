as an additional mechanism for protein degradation. a summary of the main routes for protein degradation is shown in fig. 1the ubiquitin proteasome system ( ups ) and various autophagy routes as the main pathways for protein degradation ( regular turnover ) and of misfolded and aggregated proteins ( and mitochondria ) the ubiquitin proteasome system ( ups ) and various autophagy routes as the main pathways for protein degradation ( regular turnover ) and of misfolded and aggregated proteins ( and mitochondria ). several reports have analyzed chaperone protein or mrna levels in aged cells and found increased or basal amounts , whereas the stress mediated induction of chaperone expression is impaired. some of the factors mentioned so far are involved in linking chaperone functions with cellular protein degradation pathways , the ups and autophagy , for the removal of misfolded proteins. depending on the degree of oxidation , irreversible oxidation and loss of protein function may lead to degradation and/or accumulation of damaged proteins and to the formation of so called aggresomes , which display a high autophagic activity [ 51 , 52 ].
