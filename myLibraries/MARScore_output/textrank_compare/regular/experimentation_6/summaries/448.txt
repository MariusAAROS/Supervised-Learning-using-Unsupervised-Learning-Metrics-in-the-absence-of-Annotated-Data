baseline patient characteristics pre and postpropensity score matching the mean operative time was similar between 2 groups , 253 minutes in laparoscopy group and 258 minutes in laparotomy group. the mean blood loss were significant less in laparoscopy group ( 107 ml ) than laparotomy group ( 414 ml ) , there were 16 ( 9.9% ) recurrences which were similar between the 2 treatment cohorts , 7 ( 8.6% ) were observed in laparotomy group at peritoneal , liver , lung , vaginal , and abdominal incision versus 9 ( 11.1% ) in laparoscopy group at peritoneal , liver , lung , and vaginal. the mean operative time was similar between 2 groups , 253 minutes in laparoscopy group and 258 minutes in laparotomy group. the mean blood loss were significant less in laparoscopy group ( 107 ml ) than laparotomy group ( 414 ml ) , there were 16 ( 9.9% ) recurrences which were similar between the 2 treatment cohorts , 7 ( 8.6% ) were observed in laparotomy group at peritoneal , liver , lung , vaginal , and abdominal incision versus 9 ( 11.1% ) in laparoscopy group at peritoneal , liver , lung , and vaginal. the patient baseline characteristics of laparotomy and laparoscopy group were adequately balanced after matching , and then , the surgery outcomes achieved comparability.
