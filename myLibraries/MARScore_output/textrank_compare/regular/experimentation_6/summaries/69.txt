subtyping of the aws has been attempted in the past , as gross conceptualized and proposed 3 constellations of alcohol withdrawal symptoms : factor 1 hallucinogenic that consisted of nausea , tinnitus , visual disturbance , pruritus , parasthesia , muscle pain , agitation , sleep disturbance , tactile hallucinations , and hallucinations which are auditory or visual or both ; factor 2 affective and physiological that consisted of anxiety , depression , tremor , and sweats ; and factor 3 delirium that consisted of clouding of the sensorium , impairment of consciousness , and impairment of contact with the observer. it has been proposed that alcohol withdrawal symptoms in ciwa ar appear multidimensional. , we use ciwa ar as part of the measure for the management of alcohol withdrawal symptoms. most of the patients needed proton pump inhibitor drugs like pantoprazole or omeprazole for the alcohol induced dyspepsia , peptic ulcer disease , or gastroesophageal reflux disease , but these medications do not impose any effect on alcohol withdrawal symptoms. this suggests that ratings on alcohol withdrawal symptoms on the very first day may miss certain set of symptoms , which appears on and around day two and are characterized by perceptual abnormality and delirium like picture. there are three proposed physiologic bases for the symptom manifestation of alcohol withdrawal symptoms : cns excitation , adrenergic hyperactivity , and delirium , which may be attributed to different neurotransmitters and they respond selectively to different pharmacotherapy.. this study finds multidimensionality of alcohol withdrawal symptoms as measured with ciwa ar ; we found three factors explaining 68.74 percentage of variance and named as delirious , autonomic and nonspecific.
