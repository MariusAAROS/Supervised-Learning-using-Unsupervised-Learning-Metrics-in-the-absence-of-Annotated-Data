we report an unusual presentation of shoulder septic arthritis in a 43 years old man with no other clinical signs and symptoms of classical septic arthritis. we strongly recommend early imaging studies in immunocompromised patients presenting with shoulder pain and practitioners should avoid loosely diagnosing as shoulder pain with associated stiffness as frozen shoulders. the case highlights the importance of establishing anatomical and pathological diagnosis using mri in patients with shoulder pain instead of loosely diagnosing them as impingement or frozen shoulder. our experience with this patient highlights the importance of maintaining high index of suspicion for septic arthritis in immunocompromised patients presenting with atypical shoulder pain associated with stiffness. our initial pre investigation diagnosis was atypical shoulder pain and stiffness of non specific etiology in an immunocompromised patient and infection was part of the differential diagnosis not the only diagnosis. the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was raised , at 88 mm / hour ( normal range , 0 20 mm / hour ) aspiration of shoulder joint was performed and fluid was sent for aerobic and anaerobic culture , afb staining , mycobacterium culture , and mycobacterium genetic testing. most often it is hematogenous seeding of shoulder joint , however it can also happen after intraarticular steroid injections.
