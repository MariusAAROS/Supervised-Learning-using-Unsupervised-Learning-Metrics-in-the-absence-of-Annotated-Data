this initiative lays the foundation for the integration of global genotype to phenotype data ( 6 ) with indian population data and development of a federated database. a possible integration of igvbrowser with hgvbaseg2p ( 20 ) can enable researchers for cross study comparison among different populations of the world for disease gene association study. integrated annotation data from primary sources like ncbi , ucsc and hapmap have been linked with variation data from different ethnic populations in india. integrated annotation data from primary sources like ncbi , ucsc and hapmap have been linked with variation data from different ethnic populations in india. indian population representing one sixth of the world population has been the global melting pot of human diversity. the indian genome variation consortium ( igvc ) project , an initiative of the council for scientific and industrial research ( csir)was set up to develop a database of genomic variations in indian population for predictive marker discovery in complex diseases such as diabetes , asthma , neuropsychiatric , infectious and cardiovascular disorders , response to drugs , etc. thus , the igvc data provide a basal level variation data in indian population to study genetic diseases and pharmacology.. more than 50% of the snps belong to intronic regions and 15% are in coding exons.. figure 3.bar graph shows the functional annotation of candidate genes in igvc according to gene disease association..
