furthermore , caspase14 is probably not proteolytically activated by a caspase in vivo , as other caspases are not activated during epidermal differentiation ( eckhart et al. 2000 ; raymond et al. , 2007 ) , and caspase14 is not processed at an aspartate residue like other caspases but is processed at ile in man and presumably at leu in the mouse ( chien et al. , 2002 ). although almost all procaspases are constitutively expressed in the epidermis , only caspase14 has consistently been shown to be activated during epidermal cornification ( eckhart et al. , 2000b ; lippens et al. , 2000 ; raymond et al. , 2007 ). ultrastructural analysis demonstrated that spatial distribution of caspase14 in the epidermis and hair follicles is strongly conserved among several mammalian species ( alibardi et al. caspase14 was found to be associated with the nucleus , the keratohyalin granules , and the desmosomes , whereas in corneocytes , caspase14 was found in the cytoplasm and was associated with corneodesmosomes ( a modified version of desmosomes ) and nuclear remnants. the green tea phenol ( )epigallocatechin3gallate ( egcg ) is a potent activator of ap1 and has been shown to up regulate caspase14 in a p38 and jnk dependent way ( hsu et al. , 2005 , 2007 ). likewise , in the flaky skin ( fsn / fsn ) mouse model of psoriasis , topical egcg treatment causes the up regulation of caspase14 and the amelioration of psoriasis ( hsu et al. , 2007 ). the skin is the largest organ of the body and protects the organism against external physical , chemical , and biological insults such as wounding , uvb radiation , and microorganisms. this major barrier resides in the upper layers of the epidermis ( for review see segre , 2006 ).
