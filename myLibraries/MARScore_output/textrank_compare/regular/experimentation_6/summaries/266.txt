body mass index ( bmi ) was obtained at the time of transplant , at the time of sitagliptin initiation , after 12 months of sitagliptin therapy , and at the end of followup. initiation of sitagliptin therapy marked the start of followup for each patient and patients were followed up until discontinuation of sitagliptin or december 2012 , whichever came first. a total of twenty two patients were analyzed at the end of 12 months of sitagliptin therapy. ldl and hdl cholesterol values remained unchanged with sitagliptin therapy ( figures 2(c ) and 2(d ) ). overall , these findings suggest that initiating sitagliptin therapy early in the treatment of nodat , when average glucose levels are only modestly elevated , may provide long term benefits in terms of glycemic control. though some data suggests metformin is safe in the setting of chronic kidney disease , the use of metformin in kidney transplant patients is still quite controversial due to the concern about lactic acidosis and lack of data regarding metformin use in this patient population [ 911 ]. additionally , to specifically understand the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin for the treatment of nodat , patients included in the study either used sitagliptin as the initial agent for nodat or had other diabetes medications stopped prior to or at the time of sitagliptin initiation.
