in the current study , the volumes or weights of root specimens have more statistically significant value than density , md , and bl dimension. calculation of root volume and density using a precise balance proper wax stencils were molded and the roots were mounted into acyclic resin at an angle of 45 degrees to its long axis , leaving 6 mm of each root exposed [ figure 2 ]. many researchers who have carried out this type of study performed standardization , according to root length , md and bl dimensions. this is the first study in the literature to conclude that the volume or weight of root as the most important determining factors in root fracture. the most often reported reasons have been dehydration of dentin , removal of tooth structure during root canal treatment , prolonged use of high concentrations of irrigation solutions , and excessive pressure during obturation. in the literature. there are several studies in which the fracture resistance of endodontically treated teeth were evaluated or the techniques for reinforcing of these teeth were described.
