in this case , deep rocuronium induced nmb can be reversed successfully with sugammadex at doses of 2 mg / kg and in as little as 2 min. re administration of rocuronium within a short time interval after sugammadex may result in unpredictable effects of the nmb agent. since the introduction of sugammadex , rsi with rocuronium followed by reversal with sugammadex allowed for earlier establishment of spontaneous ventilation than with succinylcholine , which has many adverse side events. the benzylisoquinoline class of medications are recommended instead of re administering rocuronium within 6 h after sugammadex. a rsi for a second round of general anesthesia was performed with propofol 120 mg , midazolam 5 mg , and rocuronium 100 mg at 11:55 am. when the patient arrived at the operating room ( or ) , vital signs were within normal limits and hb was found to be 13.2 g / dl. a third round of general anesthesia was induced with propofol 120 mg and rocuronium 40 mg by the on call resident at 19:00 pm. a fourth induction of general anesthesia was performed with propofol 120 mg and rocuronium 40 mg by the same resident at 22:35 pm. , 1 twitch was seen , and an additional dose of rocuronium 10 mg was given due to bucking 20 min after the induction of anesthesia.
