the main feature of this instrumentation is the possibility to measure in vivo absorption or emission spectra at the same time on different sub cellular compartments using extremely low light intensities. we tested our apparatus by measuring absorption spectra on the eyespot and chloroplast of the unicellular alga dunaliella and emission spectra on the photoreceptor and chloroplast of the unicellular alga euglena gracilis. b ) position of the probe upon dunaliella absorption spectra of the eyespot ( a ) and a chloroplast ( b ) of dunaliella a ) fluorescent image of euglena gracilis ; b ) position of the probe upon euglena gracilis emission spectra of the photoreceptor ( a ) and a chloroplast ( b ) of euglena gracilis gaussian bands decomposition of this spectrum is easily explained as a combination of chlorophyll a bands centered at ( 410 , 435 , 444 , 585 , 615 , 626 , 634.5 , 663 , 672 , 678 , 683 , 695 nm , chlorophyll b bands centered at 412 , 428.5 , 445 , 452 , 582 , 594 , 607 , 621.5 , 652 nm , and carotenoids lutein and bands centered at 410 , 479.5 , and 510 nm , ( not shown ) , 14. the photosynthetic and the photoreceptive compartments are the main location of chromophores inside algal cells. nature evolved a very limited number of chromophores in the different evolutionary branches of the tree of life because of the similar needs of the most diverse organisms for both the detection of the external world and the interaction with it. the study of these chromophores and their distribution inside cellular structures is usually based on extractive procedures , followed by biochemical or spectroscopic assays.
