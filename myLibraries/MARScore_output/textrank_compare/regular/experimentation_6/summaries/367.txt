active ankle dorsiflexion was more effectively improved with ankle stretching exercises using an unstable inclined board than with exercises using a wooden inclined board. group 1 performed the ankle dorsiflexion stretching exercise using a wooden inclined board , and group 2 performed ankle dorsiflexion stretching exercises using an air cushioned inclined board that provided an unstable surface. the air cushioned inclined board provided an unstable surface for performing ankle dorsiflexion stretching exercises. the results showed that ankle stretching exercises using the unstable inclined board significantly increased the active dorsiflexion angle compared to that with exercises using a wooden inclined board. , the passive dorsiflexion angles did not differ significantly between the two groups after ankle stretching exercises. we believe that the use of the air cushioned inclined board provides somatosensory input and subsequently stimulates active ankle dorsiflexion by promoting automatic postural control. independent and paired t tests were used to assess within and between group differences in ankle dorsiflexion , with spss for windows ( spss , chicago , il , usa ).
