finally , as other diabetes risk scores , the model warrants further scrutiny before it can be used in other populations. most of the available algorithms for diabetes screening have been developed in caucasian [ 79 ] and asian populations [ 1013 ] and very few in other ethnic groups [ 14 , 15 ]. to date , one diabetes risk score has been developed and validated in latin america so far which was derived from one urban area in brazil , thus bearing limited generalizability to the wider region. the peruvian diabetes risk score was constructed based on the coefficients of that final regression model. a relatively recent systematic literature search found 23 different blood free prevalent diabetes risk scores : ten from europe , nine for asian populations , two from the united states , and two from middle east. as impracticality due to use of the algorithms was a common barrier to the uptake of risk scores by healthcare staff and individuals , our model , created with three of these more common variables , reached a moderate to high sensitivity depending on the used cut point. from a cross sectional point of view , with a cut point 2 , from 1000 participants assessed by the peruvian diabetes risk score , a total of 420 would be classified as undiagnosed diabetes with the detection of 20 cases and only 6 will be missing. the strengths of this study include the use of a national population based survey , including urban and rural areas across major geographical regions , to develop the peruvian diabetes risk score , as well as its validation using bootstrap but also an independent longitudinal cohort study.
