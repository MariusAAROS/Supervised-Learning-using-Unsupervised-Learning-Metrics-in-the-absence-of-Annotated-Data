the reason for the heterogeneity of the clinical features of patients with wt1 mutations is not yet clear , and we suggest that a classification based on genetic diagnosis rather than syndromatic diagnosis might be more applicable for the prediction of outcome , and routine genetic analysis to detect wt1 mutation should be applied to all idms patients. wt1 was initially identified as a gene inactivated in wilms ' tumor , although the estimated percentage of wilms ' tumors ( wts ) with wt1 mutations is only 10 15%. analysis of genotype phenotype correlation in idms suggests that at least some idms patients have a variant form of dds due to wt1 mutations ( 14 ). frasier syndrome ( fs ) is another distinctive disease associated with wt1 mutation , characterized by male pseudohermaphroditism and nephropathy with late onset esrf , and a frequent association with gonadoblastoma ( 20 ). a recent study of seven japanese idms patients reported a low rate of wt1 mutation ( 2/7 ) and a low risk of wilms ' tumor ( 0/7 ) ( 23 ). therefore , it was concluded that in idms with wt1 mutations , the risk of wilms ' tumor might not be very high. ( 24 ) recently reported two boys with incomplete dds with wt1 mutations who underwent prophylactic bilateral nephrectomy , and the removed kidneys showed nephroblastomatosis , which has malignant potential.
