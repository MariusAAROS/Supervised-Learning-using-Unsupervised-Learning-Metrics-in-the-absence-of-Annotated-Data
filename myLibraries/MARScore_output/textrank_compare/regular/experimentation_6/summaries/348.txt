methylation reduces crh gene expression in the hypothalamus as expected ; in trophoblastic bewo cells , however , promoter methylation appears to have the opposite effect as detailed before. although gene activation occurs in 5aza dc treated bewo cells [ 22 , 23 , 35 ] , it remains to be established whether transcription factors or other gene products controlled by dna methylation regulate crh expression in trophoblasts. 8br camp increased crh mrna abundance relative to vehicle at all time points ( 24 h , p = 0.0042 ; 48 h , p = 0.0066 ; 72 h , p = 0.0004 ; figure 1 ) , which confirmed previous findings of the stimulatory effects of 8br camp on crh gene expression in bewo cells. dna methylation is a developmentally regulated epigenetic modification influenced by environmental inputs [ 31 , 32 ] , which can potentially control crh gene expression during pregnancy and in response to pathogenic factors. treatment with 5aza dc decreased crh promoter methylation and abolished the cpg site specific methylation differences as expected ( figures 2 and 4 ) , but it also blocked the spontaneous increase of crh gene expression in culture ( figure 1 ). we have utilized the dynamic changes of dna methylation in the bewo cell line to explore the relationship between this epigenetic chromatin modification and crh gene expression in a trophoblastic cell type. in our experiments we used the choriocarcinoma derived bewo cell line , which is a well characterized trophoblast model exhibiting increased crh gene expression during spontaneous and camp induced syncytial differentiation similar to normal trophoblasts.
