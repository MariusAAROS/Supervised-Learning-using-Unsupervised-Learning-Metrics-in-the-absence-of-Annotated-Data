however , other factors also involved likely include ventilatory muscle loading patterns and their effects on the ventilatory controller , ventilatory muscle function , lung volumes at end expiration ( that is , intrinsic positive end expiratory pressure ( peep ) ) , gas exchange effectiveness , and cortical inputs to the patient 's ventilatory control center such as pain [ 3 5 ]. assisted / supported mechanical ventilation is designed to interact with patient muscle activity and ' share ' the work of breathing. dys synchronous interactions can overload ventilatory muscles ( ' imposed ' loads ) , compromise alveolar ventilation , overdistend alveolar units , disrupt sleep patterns , and cause patient discomfort , prompting additional sedation. if properly done , assisted /. , the ventilatory 's flow and pressure delivery must synchronize with patient effort during all three phases of breath delivery : breath initiation , flow delivery , and breath termination ( cycling ). carlucci and colleagues have recently studied patient ventilator interactions in 69 acutely ill patients receiving non invasive ventilation ( niv ) for a variety of reasons. they grouped these patients according to obstructive or restrictive pathophysiologies and carefully measured respiratory system mechanics ( including esophageal pressure a surrogate for pleural pressure ). the patients were then initiated on niv according to a standard protocol and were assessed for triggering dys synchronies defined as missed triggers , delayed triggers , or double triggers.
