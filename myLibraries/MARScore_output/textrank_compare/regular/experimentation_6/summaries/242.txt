4.37.1 ) in the group 1 ( study group ) and 4.3 months ( 95% ci : 3.65.4 ) in the group 2 ( placebo group ) clinical outcomes at the end of the study the preoperative mean diameter of ba was 4.3 1.5 mm in clopidogrel plus oral prostacycline analog group and 4.04 1.3 mm in placebo group ( p = 0.94 ). during the follow up period , from 4 weeks to 6 months , tenderness of the extremity ,. edema , and hematoma occurred in nine patients in study group , and in six in placebo group. the survival and maturation time of avf in study group and placebo group has been summarized in figure 3(p = 0.001 ). multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that avf maturation and survival rate was more than in study group ( odds ratio 2.27 ; 95% ci : 1.078.50 ; p = 0.001 ). in the early period , we detected high blood flows and lower arterial velocity in study group when we compared groups no bleeding episode such as intracranial hemorrhage in gastrointestinal tract was recorded during the active treatment period. four weeks after the surgery , avf maturation failure developed in 14 patients ( 30.4% ) in placebo group and in 4 patients ( 8% ) in clopidogrel and oral prostacycline analog group ( p = 0.001 ). the preoperative mean diameter of the vein in the study and placebo groups were 3.1 0.8 and 3.04 0.7 mm ( p = 0.96 ).
