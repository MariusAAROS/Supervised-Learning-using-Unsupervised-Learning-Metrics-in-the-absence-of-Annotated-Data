the clinical working diagnosis was pregnancy related vt of right ventricular outflow tract origin. there are few reports of new onset vt during pregnancy in absence of structural heart disease.12,13 increased sympathetic activity , as well as physiological changes associated with normal pregnancy such as increased heart rate , decreased peripheral resistance , increased stroke volume and psychological stresses are thought to be the most common precipitants of vt in pregnant women with a structurally normal hearts.14,15 the majority of outflow tract vt in structurally normal hearts originate from the right ventricular outflow tract ( rvot ) just below the pulmonary valve. given the absence of structural heart disease and risk factors for coronary disease or arrhythmia , the clinical diagnosis was catecholamine sensitive pregnancy related vt of right ventricular outflow tract origin. in addition to cardiac diseases , several systemic non cardiac disorders , including severe electrolyte derangements , thyroid function abnormalities , pulmonary embolism , anemia , and drug overdose may present with ventricular arrhythmias. a 33year old woman , ( gravida 3 , para 2 ) , at 34 weeks of gestation , presented with episodes of lightheadedness , and dyspnea. she was asymptomatic until 18 weeks of gestation , when she started having episodes of palpitations associated with presyncope. initially , the episodes were infrequent ( less than once per day ) but a gradual increase in frequency and severity was noted by the patient.
