parametric pti images derived from [ o]h2o pet / ct scans , however , have not yet been validated. parametric pti images were calculated as previously described. finally , parametric pti images were calculated as the ratio of ptf and atf images ( fig. 1 ). parametric pti images were calculated as previously described. finally , parametric pti images were calculated as the ratio of ptf and atf images ( fig. 1 ). finally , 16 myocardial vois were defined manually on parametric ptf images , according to the 16 segments model of the american heart association , after which this voi template was projected onto the parametric pti images.fig. finally , 16 myocardial vois were defined manually on parametric ptf images , according to the 16 segments model of the american heart association , after which this voi template was projected onto the parametric pti images.fig.
