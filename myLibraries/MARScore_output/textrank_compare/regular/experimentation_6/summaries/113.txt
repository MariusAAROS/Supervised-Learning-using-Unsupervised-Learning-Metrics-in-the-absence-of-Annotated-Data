was assessed by injection of dec lnps r.o. into b6 mice , followed by analysis of activation markers ( cd40 , cd80 , cd86 ) on splenic dcs after 24 hours by flow cytometry. using this approach , we assessed the ability of dec lnps ( lnps coated with scfv specific for murine dec205 , containing sirnas specific for costimulatory molecules ) to inhibit immune responses. injection of dec lnps resulted in preferential uptake of the dec lnps by splenic dec205 dcs. as seen in figure 2a , at 4 c dec205 cells bind dec lnps approximately fourfold better compared with nontargeted lnps ( nt lnps : lnps not coated with any scfv ) , or lnps coated with an isotype scfv ( iso lnps ; cho dec205 panel ). similar results were obtained when bone marrow derived dcs ( bmdcs ) , derived from wild type mice ( b6 ) were incubated with dec lnps. confocal microscopy confirmed that similar to dec205 antibody , dec lnps were targeted to lamp1 late endosomes or lysosomes ( figure 2b ). having demonstrated dec205mediated uptake of dec lnps in vitro , we investigated their localization in vivo.
