exposome explorer currently contains the most complete and comprehensive information on exposure biomarkers ever compiled from peer reviewed literature. it is also the first publicly available , web enabled database specifically dedicated to exposure biomarkers. only peer reviewed publications describing original work with biomarker measurements in observational studies conducted in human populations. adjustment of intake or biomarker measurements prior to calculation of the correlation coefficient ( e.g. energy intake by residual method or. creatinine ) as well as a list of regression variables included in the calculation ( e.g. age , smoking status , bmi , gender ) , and the use of measurement error de attenuation are also indicated.temporal reproducibility of biomarker measurements in an individual is an important characteristic of the biomarker. a high reproducibility is required when only one sample per subject is available for biomarker measurement , as in most large cohort studies. temporal reproducibility of biomarker measurements in an individual is an important characteristic of the biomarker. a high reproducibility is required when only one sample per subject is available for biomarker measurement , as in most large cohort studies.
