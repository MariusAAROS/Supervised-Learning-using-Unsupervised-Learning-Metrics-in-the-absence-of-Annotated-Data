results of viral screening for human immunodeficiency virus , hepatitis b and hepatitis c viruses were negative. antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies ( anca)associated glomerulonephritis ( gn ) is characterized by necrotizing and crescentic gn with paucity of immunoglobulin ( ig ) and complement deposition , which is also known as pauci immune crescentic gn ( 1 3 ). approximately 75% of mn represent as primary disease and the rest results from secondary causes , most commonly systemic lupus nephritis ( sle ) , infections such as hepatitis b or c viruses , malignancy , or drugs. morizane et al. have reported a case of mpo anca associated gn , which was superimposed on type3 mpgn. speculated that mpo anca associated gn might cause secondary mn as both igg1 and igg4 were present in their case ( 4 ). nasr et al. reviewed kidney biopsies from january 2000 to february 2008 and concluded that coexistence of mn and anca associated gn would be coincidental ( 1 ). anca associated gn is also associated with environmental triggers such as drugs and infections ( 9 ).
