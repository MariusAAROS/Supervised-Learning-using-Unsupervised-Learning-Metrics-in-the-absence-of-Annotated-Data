however , we devised a simple technique of minilaparotomy and gastrotomy under local anesthesia for removing such foreign bodies. endoscopy still remains an aid in performing surgical gastrotomy for delivering such complex foreign bodies under local anesthesia. however , foreign bodies such as a toothbrush can not pass out of the stomach , and the gastrointestinal tract should get rid of these objects as soon as possible to avoid pressure necrosis and gastrointestinal perforation. in the stomach , 80 90% of foreign bodies pass uneventfully through the gastrointestinal tract without complications. although these objects are extracted either by endoscopy or laparoscopic gastrostomy , we devised an innovative technique by using pneumatic gastric insufflation and extracted the toothbrush by a tiny gastrotomy under local anesthesia. the endoscope was kept inside to insufflate and distend the stomach and a minilaparotomy with gastrotomy of 1.5 2 cm was performed through the midline under local anesthesia and the toothbrush was successfully removed. the stomach is distended with the help of air insufflation through the endoscope and a small incision is made in the midepigasrium under local anesthesia and the foreign object can be removed directly under the vision of the endoscope.
