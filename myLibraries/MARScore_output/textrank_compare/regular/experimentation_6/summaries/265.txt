the values obtained by dividing the data for trunk flexion by that of complete trunk flexion , were not different for the left and right lumbar erector spinae and right thoracic erector spinae , but were significantly different for the left thoracic erector spinae ( p<0.05 ) ( table 3table 3.flexionrelaxation phenomenon ( frp ) values obtained by dividing the data for trunk flexion by those for complete trunk flexion from healthy adults and elderly individuals ( units : % ) musclesmean sdelderly females with chronic osteoarthritishealthy adult femalesleft thoracic erector spine1.47 0.55 the flexion relaxation rates were determined using both the values obtained by dividing the data for trunk extension by that of complete trunk flexion ( c / b ) and by dividing the data for trunk flexion by that of complete trunk flexion ( a / b ). the values obtained by dividing the data for trunk extension by that of complete trunk flexion were not different for the left and right lumbar erector spinae or right thoracic erector spinae ; however , they were significantly different for the left thoracic erector spinae ( p<0.05 ) ( table 2table 2.flexionrelaxation phenomenon ( frp ) values obtained by dividing the data for trunk extension by those for complete trunk flexion from healthy adults and elderly individuals ( units : % ) musclesmean sdelderly females withchronic osteoarthritishealthy adultfemalesleft thoracic erector spine1.67 0.61 therefore , the present study compared the frps of the erector spinae occurring during ( 1 ) trunk flexion , ( 2 ) complete trunk flexion , and ( 3 ) trunk extension motions in both healthy , young females and elderly females with chronic knee osteoarthritis. in the present study , surface electromyography ( emg ) ( trigno wireless system , delsys inc. , boston , ma , usa ) was used to measure the muscle activity of the healthy adult females and elderly females with chronic knee osteoarthritis while they were performing trunk flexion , complete trunk flexion , and trunk extension. metronomes were used to enable the experimental subjects of the present study to perform trunk flexion , complete trunk flexion , and trunk extension for 5 s each over a total of 15 s. the beat was set to 60 bpm , and seconds were counted so that the subjects could hear and perform each motion for 5 s. before attaching the emg electrodes , sweat and foreign matter in the experimental muscle regions were removed in order to minimize skin resistance. three motions were performed : ( a ) trunk flexion , ( b ) complete trunk flexion , and ( c ) trunk extension.
