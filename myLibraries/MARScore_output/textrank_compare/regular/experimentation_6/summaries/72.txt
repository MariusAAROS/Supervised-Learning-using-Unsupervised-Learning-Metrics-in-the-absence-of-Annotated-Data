multipath signals occur in numerous microwave and rf applications when an unwanted portion of the original transmission propagates along any alternate path and ultimately couples to the receiver distorting the amplitude and phase of the desired signal [ 14 ]. the potential for interference from multipath signals increases substantially in near field applications ( figure 1(b ) ) , especially in situations where the receiving and transmitting hardware are integrated. however , surface waves can cause multipath signals that can be especially difficult to eliminate in near field systems.. we demonstrate cases from our current imaging system , where the measurements indicate corruption of the desired signals from multipath signals associated with the base of the tank. clearly , the resultant phase and amplitude errors can become very significant for multipath signals that are on the same order of magnitude as the desired signals. figures 5(a ) , 5(b ) , and 5(c ) show three illumination tanks with different heights , arrays of monopole antennas , and coaxial feed lines that were fabricated from the same plexiglas and had identical diameters and wall / base thicknesses as figure 2(a ) tank. at 900 mhz , the measured levels are high for the receivers closest to the transmitter ( relative receiver numbers 1 , 2 , 14 , and 15 ) compared to the rest of the array and do not change dramatically with changes in antenna height.
