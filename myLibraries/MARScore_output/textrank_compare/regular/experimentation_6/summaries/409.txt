the who / paho recommendations published in 1997 contain in detail the actions that who country members have to observe with regard to e. histolytica species infection. d ) trophozoites of e. histolytica species with phagocyted erythrocytes ( dic 40 ) knowledge of both species with different pathogenic phenotypes comes from a large scientific debate during the second half of the twentieth century , which gave rise to the rapid development of diagnosis technology based on molecular and immunological strategies.[59 ] during the last 10 years , knowledge of the new epidemiology of amoebiasis in different geographic endemic and non endemic areas has been obtained through the application of mostly molecular techniques.[1014 ] the only known natural host of e. histolytica is the human body with the large intestine as the major target organ. amoebiasis is also considered a sexually transmitted disease , particularly in sexual relationships between men and in individuals with sexual anilingus practices.. clinical and etiological diagnosis of intestinal and extra intestinal amoebiasis is neither easy or simple in part because of the discovery of two species made from the previously known e. histolytica species , both indistinguishable under microscopy. e. histolytica sensu stricto is the potentially pathogenic species and e. dispar the commensal non pathogenic entamoeba. moreover , these molecular epidemiology studies have unveiled the extraordinary genetic variability[1315 ] of e. histolytica and e. dispar , allowing the discovery of other entamoeba species , such as e. moshkowskii , which can also infect the human intestine with a significant frequency. while years of scientific discussions have left brump 's theory behind , no molecular technology prior to the 1990s allowed clear differentiation of the currently known e. histolytica and e. dispar species in terms of pathogenic or non pathogenic phenotypes.
