polyarginine peptides are known as one of the widely used classes of cell penetrating peptides ( cpps ) and cellular delivery tools. herein , we designed acylated cyclic polyarginine peptides ( acpps ) containing five arginine residues and investigated their ability as cell penetrating peptides. after 1 h incubation , trypsin edta solution was added to detach cells from the plate s surface and remove cell surface binding peptides.. after 5 min , the complete media ( 2 ml ) were added to neutralize the trypsin. however , dodecanoyl linear ( r5 ) and [ r5 ] did not exhibit significant cytotoxicity at 25 m and showed less than 20% toxicity at the concentration of 100 m. in sk ov3 cells , dodecanoyl(r5 ) and [ r5 ] showed more than 80% cell viability at the concentration of 25 m. in normal cells ( hek 293 t ) , all peptides exhibited less than 5% toxicity at 25 m. this differential behavior of the peptides in normal , and cancer cells can be possibly rationalized through the interaction between polyarginine peptides and cell membranes. comparison of cytotoxicity between cyclic and linear acylated polyarginine peptides and nonacylated cyclic peptide [ r5 ] at various concentrations against ccrf cem , sk ov3 , and hek 293 t after 24 h. the intracellular uptake studies of fluorescein labeled acylated cyclic and linear pp , fdodecanoyl[r5 ] and fdodecanoyl(r5 ) , was carried out in sk ov3 cells by using flow cytometry and confocal laser scanning microscopy ( clsm ) methods. the fdodecanoyl[r5 ] and fdodecanoyl(r5 ) showed approximately 13.7 and 10.3fold higher cellular uptake than that of control 5,6carboxyfluorescein ( fam ) , respectively , in sk ov3 cells. fdodecanoyl[r5 ] showed higher fluorescence intensity compared to that of fdodecanoyl(r5 ) in sk ov3 cells.
