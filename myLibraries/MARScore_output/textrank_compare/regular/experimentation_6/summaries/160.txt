the hhas were not modified in any way to optimize for the detection of toxins within water supplies despite the fact that they were initially developed to test for concentrated agent collected from high efficiency aerosol collectors and impinged into a phosphate buffered saline ( pbs ) solution rather than to test unbuffered water supplies.. the ability of the hhas to detect seb and ricin in four different water matrices , representative of waters used by different branches of the armed forces , was evaluated. the four different water matrices were formulated tap water , formulated tap water with 1 mg / l free available chlorine ( fac ) , water treated by reverse osmosis ( ro ) with 1 mg / l fac , and ro water with 2 mg / l total residual bromine. the protection of water supplies and water distribution infrastructure such as reservoirs is of great concern for those defending against bioterrorism. to protect potable water supplies , the department of defense ( dod ) seeks to develop a rapid field test that would determine if field supplies of water are safe to drink by the warfighter during a military operation. therefore , detection of ricin and seb in water at or below the suggested health effect level is desired. briefly , approximately 500 ml of astm type i deionized water was added to a one liter volumetric flask to which each stock solution was added to achieve the desired final concentration and the total volume was brought to one liter with deionized water. briefly , one gram of calcium hypochlorite was added to twenty milliliters of astm type i deionized water and shaken vigorously for one to two minutes.
