a i versus u plot for pn junction formed with p and n type gels ( p4n4 ) , b i versus u plot for the junction formed with neat gels ( p1n1 ). these gels were prepared for electrical measurements in similar way with p type gels. these gels were prepared for electrical measurements in similar way with p type gels. similarly , nipa gel was doped with maptac , having cl as counter ions , so called n type semiconducting gel. n type gels were synthesized , similar to p type , as free radical cross linking co polymerization of n isopropylacrylamide ( nipa ) and n , nmethylene bisacrylamide ( bis ) as crosslink agent in the presence of methacrylamidopropyltrimethylammonium chloride ( maptac ) in varying amount , 3 10 , 3 10 , 3 10 mol / l [ 13 15 ]. n type gels were synthesized , similar to p type , as free radical cross linking co polymerization of n isopropylacrylamide ( nipa ) and n , nmethylene bisacrylamide ( bis ) as crosslink agent in the presence of methacrylamidopropyltrimethylammonium chloride ( maptac ) in varying amount , 3 10 , 3 10 , 3 10 mol / l [ 13 15 ]. j / mgel versus applied voltage , u , for the doped gel ( p3 ) swollen in ( a ) pure water , b and in dmso all the above mentioned measurements were repeated for n type gels , and the similar results were reproduced.
