we find that this is a rapid and accurate way to identify ncs , even in a case where the map is poor and the correlation of ncs related density is low. once a set of candidate ncs operators is obtained , the correlation of ncs related density is examined in the original map , and the ncs operators are refined. a region with arbitrary shape surrounding this point is then chosen by sequential addition of new boundary points such that the local correlation of ncs related density at each point in the region is above a threshold ( typically 1/4 of the maximum correlation in the region ). if the final correlation of ncs related density ( averaged over all pairs of ncs related points ) is above a threshold ( typically 0.4 ) then the ncs operators are considered to represent actual ncs in the crystal and are used in later stages of structure determination. once a set of candidate ncs operators is obtained , the correlation of ncs related density is examined in the original map , and the ncs operators are refined. a region with arbitrary shape surrounding this point is then chosen by sequential addition of new boundary points such that the local correlation of ncs related density at each point in the region is above a threshold ( typically 1/4 of the maximum correlation in the region ). if the final correlation of ncs related density ( averaged over all pairs of ncs related points ) is above a threshold ( typically 0.4 ) then the ncs operators are considered to represent actual ncs in the crystal and are used in later stages of structure determination.
