chest x ray was normal and abdominal x ray did not show signs of bowel obstruction. ct is also helpful in discriminating bezoars from other causes of bowel obstruction such as gastrointestinal malignancies , gallstone ileus , etc. in our case. bezoars are responsible for 0.44% of cases of mechanical intestinal obstruction , which occurs mainly in the stomach and small intestine. bezoar is a rare disorder , however , it must be suspected in case of mechanical intestinal obstruction. ct scan revealed a focal circumferential thickening of the sigmoid colon with an ovoid and encapsulated intraluminal mass measuring 4.7 3.6 cm [ figure 2 ]. dilatation of the proximal segment with abundant fecal material was seen [ figure 2 ]. contrast enhanced computed tomography ( ct ) is the method of choice to identify the location , severity , and etiology of intestinal obstruction. if treatment is delayed , colonic bezoars can be complicated by intestinal obstruction and perforation with consequent peritonitis.
