as for cardiac trail , trail protein expression decreased in the apoe and apoe + dm groups ( data not shown ). by contrast , in the heart , dyslipidemia was the major determinant of opg / trail tissue changes , not only by increasing opg but also by reducing trail gene expression. opg and trail are both members of the tnf superfamily , and they are widely expressed in different tissues , including the heart and the vessels , in health and disease states [ 4 , 5 ]. although initially opg actions seemed to be limited to bone metabolism and those of trail to host defense against tumors , recent studies have suggested that both molecules might actually be involved in cvd development and progression. epidemiological studies have shown that there is an association between circulating opg , trail , and cvd. opg was found to be directly correlated [ 5 , 8 , 9 ] , while trail was inversely correlated , with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality [ 10 , 11 ]. likewise , opg was significantly associated with the level of c reactive protein , which is an independent predictor of acute vascular events and adverse outcomes , while trail was negatively correlated with it.
