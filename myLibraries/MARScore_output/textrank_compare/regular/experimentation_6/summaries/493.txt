the identification of this highly reduced set of plastid genes as comprising the plastid genome is also supported by recent results demonstrating that at least some of the missing genes ( i.e. ones normally found in plastids ) are instead nuclear encoded in several species ( 1719 ). the unusual 3 terminal polyuridylylation , if a common feature of dinoflagellate plastid transcripts , suggested that analysis of cdna synthesized using an oligo(da ) instead of the usual oligo(dt ) primer would provide a straightforward method to catalog the plastid gene complement. our data reveals no evidence for uridine insertion although numerous examples of substitutional editing in dinoflagellate plastid transcripts ( principally a to g ) were observed ( table 2 , supplementary figures s1 and s2 ). only transcripts from known minicircle genes are polyuridylylated in lingulodinium various patterns of substitutional editing are found in dinoflagellate plastid transcripts these experiments suggest that dinoflagellates do not obey for the rules normally governing plastid gene transfer to the nucleus ( 20 ). the evolutionary ancestor of the peridinin containing plastids is suggested from molecular phylogenetic reconstructions using plastid encoded genes to be a red alga ( 3,4 ) , a conclusion supported by phylogeny of nuclear encoded plastid directed genes ( 5 ). although dinoflagellates are best known as the notorious cause of toxic red tides , they are also important contributors to the ocean 's primary production.
