skoffer and foldspang ( 6 ) reported that of several sports activities , only swimming was associated with a decreased prevalence of lbp. moreover , both physical inactivity and intensive sports activity have been associated with lbp in some studies ( 28 , 32 , 3941 ). in the analysis of risk factors for lbp in sports training , we found that in both sexes combined , lbp was positively associated with fatigue ( caused by the long time spent in training ) , gymnastics , judo , handball , and volleyball. on the basis of the collected data , participants were dichotomized into those with or without lbp , while indicating the sports discipline in which they were injured or that they were injured after cumulative fatigue due to the large number of hours spent in practicing sports and physical activities. lbp was defined as pain or discomfort in the low back region , from the lower rib curvature to the lower part of the seat region. the question used systematically by the doctor of the institute health service to identify and estimate lbp cases was about the present injury and if and when they had lbp in the past. furthermore , every registered injury causing lbp was recorded with its severity , but the most important detail for us was the sport in which the student was injured.
