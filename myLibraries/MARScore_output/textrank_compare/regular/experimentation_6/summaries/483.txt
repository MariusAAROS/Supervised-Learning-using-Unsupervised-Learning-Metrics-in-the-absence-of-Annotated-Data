tissue sections on copper film grids were examined using a transmission electron microscope ( jeol1400 ; jeol usa , inc. , peabody , ma , usa ). tissue sections on copper film grids were examined using a transmission electron microscope ( jeol1400 ; jeol usa , inc. , peabody , ma , usa ). primary human schlemm 's canal cell lines were grown to confluence in six well plates ( bd falcon , franklin lakes , nj , usa ) containing dulbecco 's modified eagle 's medium ( dmem ; life technologies , grand island , ny , usa ) ; 10% fetal bovine serum ( mediatech , manassas , va , usa ) ; and 1% penicillin / streptomycin ( life technologies ) in 5% co2 at 37c. cells were incubated with latanoprost ( de esterified free acid form at 100 nm final concentration ; cayman chemical , ann arbor , mi , usa ) or vehicle ( ethanol , final dilution 1:1000 ) in dmem containing 1% penicillin / streptomycin. cell lysates containing 20 g total protein were mixed with reducing lane marker sample buffer ( thermo fisher scientific , waltham , ma , usa ) containing 15% 2mercaptoethanol ( sigma aldrich corp. , st. louis , mo , usa ) , heated and separated on a 4% to 15% sds page gradient gel ( bio rad laboratories , inc. ). proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane ( millipore corp. , billerica , ma , usa ) in 1x transfer buffer ( 50 mm tris , 384 mm glycine , 0.01% sds , 20% methanol ). blots were probed with rabbit monoclonal anti human stc1 ( novus biologicals , littleton , co , usa ) and mouse monoclonal anti human gapdh ( novus biologicals ).
