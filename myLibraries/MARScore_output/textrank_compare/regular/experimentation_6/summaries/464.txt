in the present study , ghrelin correlated to positively with tnf , in acyanotic patients and cyanotic patients with chd. alteration of endocrine mediators of growth has been implicated as a possible mechanism of growth failure in cyanotic patients. the study was conducted on 47 children with acyanotic chd , 21 children with cyanotic chd , and 25 healthy children. although growth impairment is most pronounced in infants with cyanotic chd , growth failure does not correlate well with the degree of hypoxia. patients with acyanotic heart disease had a greater growth deficit in weight , and those with cyanotic heart disease had a greater growth deficit in stature as demonstrated by both decreased height and weight. we observed the mentioned correlation , both in children with cyanotic heart disease and in children with acyanotic heart disease. ghrelin , a 28amino acide peptide , is a potent stimulator of growth hormone release that has been implicated in the control of food intake and energy homeostasis in human begins and rodents [ 15 ].
