1. sds page gel shows gst protein bands with 24kda in parasite and 25kda in healthy liver samples. lanes 1 3 are healthy liver samples. 1. sds page gel shows gst protein bands with 24kda in parasite and 25kda in healthy liver samples. increase of liver protein and gst in infected mice indicates the occurrence of oxidative stress in hepatocytes due to infection ( 18 ). statistical t test showed gst enzyme activity of parasite was lower than healthy liver tissues ( p < 0.05 ). statistical t test showed gst enzyme activity of parasite was lower than healthy liver tissues ( p < 0.05 ). significant higher gst specific activities in cystic liver samples was observed as compared with healthy liver ( p < 0.05 ).
