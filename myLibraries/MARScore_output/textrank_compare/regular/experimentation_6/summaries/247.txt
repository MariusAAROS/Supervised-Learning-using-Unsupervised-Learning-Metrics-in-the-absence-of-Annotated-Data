macrophages including cholesterol droplets , multinucleated giant cells , lymphocytes , and the absence of adamantinomatous components are consistent with those previously reported by paulus et al. clinically , xanthogranuloma in the sellar region has been reported to cause severe endocrinological deficits ( 7 ). xanthogranuloma of the sellar region is characterized by a granulomatous lesion containing cholesterol clefts , macrophages , chronic inflammatory infiltrates , and hemosiderin deposit ( 6 ). histological examination of the tumor showed fibrous tissue with cholesterol clefts , macrophages , multinucleated giant cells , and lymphocyte infiltration ( fig. histological examination of the tumor showed fibrous tissue with cholesterol clefts , macrophages , multinucleated giant cells , and lymphocyte infiltration ( fig. as with craniopharyngiomas , the signal characteristics are variable on the t1 and t2weighted images due to the variable quality of the cyst fluid. these conditions include xanthomatous hypophysitis , xanthogranulomatous hypophysitis and xanthogranuloma of the sellar region ( 1,2,3,4,5 ). ( 7 ) suggested that xanthogranuloma is likely to constitute a different entity from the classical adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma clinically and pathologically.
