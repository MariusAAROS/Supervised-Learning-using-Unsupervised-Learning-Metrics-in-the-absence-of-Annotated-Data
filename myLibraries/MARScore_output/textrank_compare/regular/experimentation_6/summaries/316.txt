ground powder was hydrated in proteasome buffer ( 50 mm tris hcl [ ph7.5 ] , 5 mm mgcl2 , 1 mm edta , and 10% glycerol ) supplemented with 2 mm atp , protease inhibitor tablets ( complete , roche ) , 2 mm pmsf , 1 mm benzamidine , 10 g / ml pepstatin a , and 1 g / ml antipain. ground powder was hydrated in proteasome buffer ( 50 mm tris hcl [ ph7.5 ] , 5 mm mgcl2 , 1 mm edta , and 10% glycerol ) supplemented with 2 mm atp , protease inhibitor tablets ( complete , roche ) , 2 mm pmsf , 1 mm benzamidine , 10 g / ml pepstatin a , and 1 g / ml antipain. resins were collected at 900 g for 2 min at 4c and washed with proteasome buffer containing 50 mm nacl three times , followed by a final wash with proteasome buffer alone. bp1 was then released from the resin by incubating with actev protease ( invitrogen ) at 2.5 unit / l culture in proteasome buffer containing 2 mm atp and protease inhibitors for 1 hr at 30c. resins were collected at 900 g for 2 min at 4c and washed with proteasome buffer containing 50 mm nacl three times , followed by a final wash with proteasome buffer alone. bp1 was then released from the resin by incubating with actev protease ( invitrogen ) at 2.5 unit / l culture in proteasome buffer containing 2 mm atp and protease inhibitors for 1 hr at 30c. cells were harvested , washed once with ice cold water and drop frozen in liquid nitrogen.
