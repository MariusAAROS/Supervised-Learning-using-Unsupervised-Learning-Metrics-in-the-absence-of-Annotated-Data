further measured the anterior neck soft tissue at the hyoid bone and thyrohyoid membrane levels , which is important to displace the glottis by the laryngoscopic blade , and found that us measurements of anterior neck soft tissue thickness at the level of hyoid bone and thyrohyoid membrane can be used to predict difficult laryngoscopies , and a 2.8cm us measurement at the thyrohyoid membrane was a good independent predictor of difficult laryngoscopy. et al. further demonstrated that the anterior neck soft tissue thickness measured by ultrasound at hyoid bone and thyrohyoid membrane levels can be used as an index to predict difficult laryngoscopy , but only the anterior neck soft tissue thickness at thyrohyoid membrane levels can be used as an independent predictor of difficult laryngoscopy. interestingly , they did not find a correlation between us measurements and clinical screening tests.. also found that an abundance of fat tissue at the anterior neck region as detected by ultrasound in israeli obesity patients was a very good independent predictor of difficult laryngoscopy , being a much better predictor than body mass index ( bmi ) per se. however , a similar study in the unites states showed that us quantification of anterior soft tissue and general bedside screening tests failed to predict difficult laryngoscopy in american obese patients , suggesting that racial or body shape differences might exist. to define the role of airway us in predicting difficult laryngoscopy. , we evaluated the feasibility of ultrasound in predicting difficult laryngoscopy in a chinese han population. there were 28 of 203 patients ( 13.8% ) categorized as difficult laryngoscopy , and 50% of patients with difficult laryngoscopy in our study were males.
