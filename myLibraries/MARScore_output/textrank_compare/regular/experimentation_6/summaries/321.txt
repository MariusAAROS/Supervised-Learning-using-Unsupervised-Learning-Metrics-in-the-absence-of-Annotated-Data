however , it is often practically difficult to achieve ideal nutrition support in sick elbw infants , the current incidence of rickets in elbw infants is unknown , and the relationship of the severity of overall illness and degree of prematurity in this population is unclear. the aim of this study was to characterize the risk factors for development of rickets in elbw infants fed with high mineral containing preterm formula. rickets of prematurity was diagnosed in 43.9% of elbw infants and fracture in 13%. in univariate analysis , elbw infants with rickets had a significantly higher occurrence of pda ( p = 0.025 ) , pnac ( p = 0.041 ) , severe pnac ( p = 0.013 ) , bpd ( p = 0.019 ) , and moderate / severe bpd ( p = 0.012 ) in multiple regression analysis after adjustment of gestation and birth weight , rickets in elbw infants significantly correlated with severe pnac ( or 18.5 ; 95% ci , 1.1 285 ; p = 0.042 ) and moderate / severe bpd ( or 3.2 ; 95% ci , 1.2 26.5 ; however , for increasing the survival of elbw infants , significant co morbid conditions could affect actual mineral intake which might mitigate the effect of high mineral fortification ( 13 ). this is the first study to focus on the incidence of rickets in elbw infants after 2 decades of fortified formula use in korea.
