western blots analysis revealed that chop expression increased with age in both wt mice and 5fad mice ( n = 7 , t = 2.806 , p < 0.05 for 12month old wt mice vs. 2month old wt mice ). western blots analysis revealed that chop expression increased with age in both wt mice and 5fad mice ( n = 7 , t = 2.806 , p < 0.05 for 12month old wt mice vs. 2month old wt mice ). a accumulation was increased in the brain tissues of 7month old mice and amyloid plaque deposition appeared around neurons secreting a. in 12month old mice , a large amount of plaque deposition was observed in the brain tissues [ figure 1b ].
