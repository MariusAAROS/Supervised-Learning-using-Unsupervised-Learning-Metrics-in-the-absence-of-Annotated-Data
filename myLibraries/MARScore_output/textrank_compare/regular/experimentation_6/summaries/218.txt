pon1 activity decreased to about three fourth ( 3/4 ) of original level after 15 weeks of atherogenic diet feeding to pon1tg mice , and to less than one half ( 1/2 ) of original level in control animals. adenovirus mediated delivery of human pon1 gene ( 55 m , 192q genotype ) in double knockout leptin/ ( ob / ob ) , ldlr/ mouse resulted in more than 4fold increase of pon1 activity on day 7 with gradual decrease to the control level by day 21. another meta analysis published in 2012 included 43 studies with total 20,629 subjects showed similar association of pon1 activity and cad with standardized mean difference ( smd ) of 0.78 ( p < 0.001 ) for cad subjects compared with controls. that might results in difference in protein expression levels between alleles and ultimately in pon1 activity and protection , although it was not assessed in the study. also , transfection of pon1deficient peritoneal macrophages ( isolated from pon1 knockout mice ) with human pon1 decreased level of peroxides , lowered release of superoxide , and increased intracellular level of reduced glutathione , key observations are summarized in table 1. macrophages from this mouse did not protect ldl from oxidation by other cells in vitro , and pon1 knockout mice developed atherosclerosis faster than control mice on high fat , high cholesterol diet. pon1 protein level in human serum varies more than 13fold , and variations in the sequence of promoter region of pon1 gene might cause difference in its expression.
