sclerotherapy is an effective , conservative and low cost technique for the treatment of benign vascular lesions , included vascular malformation. treatment success was determined clinically by reduction in lesion size , ability of the patient to chew and to clean his teeth without bleeding , patient experience to pain and by patient satisfaction. c ) and d ) axial t2 weighted magnetic resonance image shows high intensity lesion with flow representing vessels of different sizes.. a ) axial and b ) coronal computed tomography scan obtained with contrast material shows dilated vessels that extend into the infratemporal area and multiple phleboliths can be seen. c ) and d ) axial t2 weighted magnetic resonance image shows high intensity lesion with flow representing vessels of different sizes.. figure 3a ) the catheter loaded with ethanol in place during injection ; b ) contrast medium is injected into the lesion and an x ray is taken to make sure that the catheter is within the lesion itself ; c ) an angiogram shows ethanol injection within the lesion.. a ) the catheter loaded with ethanol in place during injection ; b ) contrast medium is injected into the lesion and an x ray is taken to make sure that the catheter is within the lesion itself ; c ) an angiogram shows ethanol injection within the lesion.. figure 4a ) postoperative picture of the lesion one and b ) three months following injection.. a ) postoperative picture of the lesion one and b ) three months following injection. vascular malformation is known as one of the major therapeutic problem even to the most experienced clinicians. these malformations grow proportionately with age , and may involve multiple anatomical spaces and encase critical neuromuscular structures , associated with nerve damage , massive bleeding , and deformity.
