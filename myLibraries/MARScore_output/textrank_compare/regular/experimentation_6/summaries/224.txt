therefore , second line and further line treatment costs , capturing the various treatment strategies used following progression , were not accounted for within the model. therefore , second line and further line treatment costs , capturing the various treatment strategies used following progression , were not accounted for within the model. monthly costs of erlotinib and pemetrexed comprising administration , acquisition , and adverse event costs ( table 3 ) derived from a manuscript in press28 ( published in part at a recent scientific conference24,25 ) show erlotinib has lower monthly per patient treatment costs. the prognosis for patients with non small cell lung cancer ( nsclc ) deteriorates with advancing disease stage , and only about 1% of patients with metastatic nsclc are alive after 5 years.1 the most appropriate treatment for these patients is palliative , systemic , platinum based chemotherapy in first line.25 however , platinum based , first line treatment is limited to 46 cycles due to cumulative toxicity and a plateau in effectiveness. hence , there is a need for therapies that prolong the clinical benefits of first line treatment. an alternative treatment strategy that can be used to prolong duration of first line treatment and extend survival in metastatic nsclc is first line maintenance therapy. the model does not include post progression free survival treatments ( following disease progression ) once maintenance therapy is stopped , because it was not designed to incorporate this information.
