needles consist of nnn molecules with a ( 111 ) lying orientation ( see figure 1c ). ( b ) a side view of nnn molecules packed in the observed crystal structure. the adsorption distance has been optimized , yielding a distance of 1.6 of the lowest h atom of edge on nnn molecules to the substrate surface. the epitaxial relationship between fibers and islands is consistent with the structural analysis and can be explained by a nucleation of nnn molecules at the fiber side walls , also called ledge directed epitaxy. taking a top view of the molecular stacking at the contact plane of b type crystallites , which is depicted in the right panel of figure 6. , reveals that ( 111 ) orientated fibers are built up by an alternating assembly of only one enantiomer ( red ) and edge on nnn molecules. the orientation of the long molecular axis ( lma ) or long needle axis ( lna ) is indicated by blue or red arrows.. taking a closer look at the molecular stacking at the contact plane of b type crystallites reveals that ( 111 ) orientated crystals are alternately assembled by red enantiomers and edge on nnn molecules.. because nnn molecules can adsorb either in their left or right handed configuration , simulations have been performed for both enantiomers and are color coded by red and blue filled curves.
