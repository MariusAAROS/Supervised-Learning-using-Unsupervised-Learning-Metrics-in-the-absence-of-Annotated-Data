the patella begins to engage the trochlea during knee flexion , and patellofemoral instability typically manifests during the terminal 30 of knee extension. the objective of our study was to determine the impact of knee position and quadriceps contraction on patellofemoral indices measured on mri. the mean values of the insall salvati ratio were normal in all combinations of knee position and quadriceps contraction. , we aimed to assess the influence of knee position and quadriceps activity on frequently measured patellofemoral indices. it has been demonstrated that patellofemoral instability typically manifests during the terminal 30 of knee extension with contraction of the quadriceps femoris muscle14 ). thus , it is important that potential confounders ( e.g. quadriceps contraction and knee extension ) are minimised in order to achieve more reliable measurements upon which surgical decision making is based. the mean values of the caton deschamps index were within the normal range with knee flexed but were abnormally elevated with the knee extended , both with the quadriceps relaxed and contracted.
