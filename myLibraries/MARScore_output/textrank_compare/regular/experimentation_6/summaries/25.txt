a weak positive correlation was found between precontrast creatinine and urine il18 levels , although it was not statistically significant. , we aimed to compare the plasma creatinine levels with spot urine il18 levels following radiocontrast administration. spot urine il18 levels were measured before and 6 and 24 h after radiocontrast administration with a human il18 elisa kit ( biosource invitrogen human il18 , california ). spot urine il18 levels in patients before and after radiocontrast agent administration plasma creatinine levels and spot urine il18 were weakly but positively correlated with those during the precontrast period , although this finding was not statistically significant ( r=0.246 , p=0.126 ). spot urine il18 levels at sixth hour following radiocontrast administration suggesting that it may be an earlier parameter for identifying kidney injury. some reports have shown that il18 levels start to increase within 46 h and peak at 12 h in patients with acute renal injury. similarly , postcontrast 24h plasma creatinine levels and spot urine il18 levels were weakly but positively correlated , although this result was also not statistically significant ( r=0.254 , p=0.276 ).
