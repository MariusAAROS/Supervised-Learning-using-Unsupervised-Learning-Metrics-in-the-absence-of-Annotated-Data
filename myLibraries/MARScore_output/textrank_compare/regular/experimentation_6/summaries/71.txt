9 the feature of the calcification was commonly described as a stippled or patchy configuration that may include some degrees of hemorrhage.8 9 10 dense calcification was exceptionally reported by sarkar et al.2 the rate of hydrocephalus in association with cpp is 90% and the rate increases up to 100% in malignant cpps.8 the cause of hydrocephalus was considered a combination of cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) overproduction ( four to five times that in healthy persons ) , obstruction of csf pathways by the tumor mass , impaired csf absorption , increased protein content of csf around the tumor , subarachnoid scarring or granulations related to recurrent bleeding from the tumor , elevated intraventricular pulse pressure , and adhesions around the exit foramina of the fourth ventricle caused by highly proteinaceous or hemorrhagic csf.2 10 18 the finding of tumor calcification in the cpa generally required consideration of differential diagnosis with papillary or psammomatous meningioma , melanotic schwannoma , and myxopapillary ependymoma. most cpp in adults occurs within the fourth ventricle.9 10 11 a small number of the tumors have been reported to be located in extraventricular regions , the cpa , or the cerebellar hemisphere or the suprasellar cistern.8 10 12 cpp within the cpa was first described by cushing in 1917.13 to date , cpp within the cpa has been reported in 7 to 9% of all cpts and is most exclusively found in adults.9 11 14 15 it is divided into two categories according to the origin of the tumor ; one is primary extraventricular cpts and the other is a result of a direct extension of fourth ventricular tumors through the foramen of luschka.15 because the tumor of our case revealed no connection from the fourth ventricle , it is considered to originate from small choroid tufts that normally project from each recess at the foramen luschka into the cpa or from ectopic choroidal islets unconnected with the choroid plexus.16 the cpp of our case indicated dense calcification with ventricular enlargement. the majority of choroid plexus tumors ( cpts ) originate in the ventricular system , 43 to 67% in the lateral ventricle , 24 to 39% in the fourth ventricle , and 9.5 to 11% in the third ventricle , respectively.8 9 the common site of origin differs in each pediatric and adult group. total removal of cpts is recommended and seems to be feasible since a significant prognostic factor was relevant to the extent of tumor removal , and no definitive evidence of the beneficial effect of radiotherapy has been reported6 18 19 20. choroid plexus papilloma ( cpp ) is a rare benign tumor accounting for 0.5% of all intracranial tumors that is more common in childhood , consisting of 1.5 to 6.4% of pediatric intracranial tumors.1. 2 the majority of cpps occur during the first 2 years of life , with 12.5 to 20% ( 10 to 12% ) reported in infants under 1 year of age.1 3 there have been some reports of calcified cpp , cpp in an adult ,. cpp in the cerebellopontine angle ( cpa ) , and atypical form of cpp.4 5 6 7 however , a case combining with these four features adult , dense calcification , atypical form , and cpa is considered to be extremely rare ; such a case has never been encountered among the 8,540 skull base tumors on which the senior author ( t.f. ) has operated in the past 20 years.
