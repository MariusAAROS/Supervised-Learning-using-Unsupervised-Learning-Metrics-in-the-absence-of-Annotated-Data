the association between microalbuminuria and c ad total score was investigated with multiple linear regression analyses. the association between microalbuminuria and c ad total score was investigated with multiple linear regression analyses. after adjustment for potential confounding factors , c ad total score was still borderline associated with microalbuminuria ( 0.16 [ 0.01 to 0.33 ] ) further adjustment for other cardiovascular risk factors only slightly further attenuated these rrs ( model 3 ) , and when the c ad total score or microalbuminuria was added to these models , the rr attributable to microalbuminuria remained practically unchanged and both microalbuminuria ( 2.13 [ 1.094.17 ] ) and c ad total score ( 1.76 [ 1.052.94 ] ) were independently associated with cardiovascular mortality ( model 4 ). rr of microalbuminuria vs. normoalbuminuria or per sd ( = 0.605 ) increase in c ad total score. among individuals with normo versus microalbuminuria ( a ) and across tertiles of c ad total score ( b ). both microalbuminuria and c ad total score were also associated with all cause mortality ( table 3 , model 1 ).
