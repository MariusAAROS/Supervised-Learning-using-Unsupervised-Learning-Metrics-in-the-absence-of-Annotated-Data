while this study has identified qis and quality improvement mechanisms to assess care quality for dementia , findings underscore the importance of system integration for the provision of quality dementia care , with specifically defined and mutually understood roles among stakeholders and , where necessary , the reallocation of existing resources to support this approach to care. closer integration of urban specialists with rural pcmcs represents a tremendous opportunity to extend quality dementia care , particularly to rural patients. finally , candidate qis and quality improvement mechanisms were not identified through a systematic literature review , but the use of published guidelines and compendiums likely identified the most important elements of quality dementia care , which would thus have remained highly ranked. finally , candidate qis and quality improvement mechanisms were not identified through a systematic literature review , but the use of published guidelines and compendiums likely identified the most important elements of quality dementia care , which would thus have remained highly ranked. access to other health care professionals , within pcmcs and in the community , was identified as important for quality care , though access was not perceived as uniform. they also identified specialists as agents to promote care quality , particularly in the context of a shared care approach. access to other health care professionals , within pcmcs and in the community , was identified as important for quality care , though access was not perceived as uniform.
