postoperative pain scores and additional analgesic requirements according to operative techniques data are presented as mean standard deviation unless otherwise indicated. postoperative pain scores during single incision and conventional multiport co2 laparoscopic surgical procedures were compared previously ; however , the abdominal viscera was inflated by using co2 in all these studies. recently , gerbershagen et al studied postoperative pain scores on the first postoperative day in 70 764 german patients. postoperative pain scores during single incision and conventional multiport co2 laparoscopic surgical procedures were compared previously ; however , the abdominal viscera was inflated by using co2 in all these studies. recently , gerbershagen et al studied postoperative pain scores on the first postoperative day in 70 764 german patients. similarly , murji et al conducted a meta analysis of randomized controlled trials and high quality observational studies with > 2000 patients and failed to ascertain the impact of single incision laparoscopy surgery on postoperative pain because of the paucity of data and lack of uniform collection. in 2011 fagotti et al published their randomized controlled trial comparing postoperative pain after conventional laparoscopy and laparoendoscopic single site surgery ( less ) for benign adnexal disease.
