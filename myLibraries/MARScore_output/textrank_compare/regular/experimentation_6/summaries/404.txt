intraoral impression with acrylic assembly prototype ( extraoral impression ) prototype extraoral and intraoral impression together with acrylic assembly first generation metal plate assembled metal frame three dimensional model the accuracy of this method was verified with computed tomography ( ct ) scan. , the counter block of acrylic was made to which extraoral impression was attached [ figure 2 ]. after applying separating medium , the counter block of acrylic was made to which extraoral impression was attached [ figure 2 ]. following steps were performed to achieve a three dimensional model : intraoral impression was recorded with addition silicone putty and light body [ figure 1]fabrication of acrylic assembly for aligning both intraoral and extraoral impressiona rectangular block of acrylic was made to which impression tray was pressed to make indentations. intraoral impression was recorded with addition silicone putty and light body [ figure 1 ] fabrication of acrylic assembly for aligning both intraoral and extraoral impression a rectangular block of acrylic was made to which impression tray was pressed to make indentations. [ figures 24 ] plastic rod was used for supporting the extraoral impressionreplacing the plastic rod with metal plate and key system the plastic rod was replaced by a metal plate in the first generation [ figure 5 ] for better stability and better customization.
