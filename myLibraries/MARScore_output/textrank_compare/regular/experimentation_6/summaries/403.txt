bicondylar hoffa fracture involving both the femoral condyles is a rare injury and has anecdotally been reported in the literature [ table 1].234567 most reported cases of bicondylar hoffa fracture have two separate fracture lines and the two condyles are separated from each other. only one case of such an injury has been reported in a child.7 previously published reports of bicondylar hoffa fractures. the most widely used classification system developed by muller , updated by the ao group , and adopted by the orthopaedic trauma association ( ota ) classifies distal femoral fractures into three groups [ figure 9].10 we feel that b3.3 should be subclassified into two groups : type b3.3a conjoint bicondylar hoffa fracture where the two condyles are joined by a bride of intact bone and occurs due to a posterior and upward directed force with a semiflexed knee without any varus or valgus [ figure 7 ]. nonoperative treatment in the form of plaster cast or skeletal traction leads to loss of extension , nonunion , instability , joint contracture , and deformity.239 therefore , anatomical reduction of articular surface , stable fixation , and early mobilization should be the aim of treatment.11 for open reduction of bicondylar hoffa fracture , most authors have used a combined medial and lateral approach. hoffa fracture usually results from high velocity trauma following road traffic accidents or fall from height. the specific mechanism of injury that produces hoffa fracture is not known. we describe a rare case of conjoint bicondylar hoffa fracture where both the femoral condyles were joined by a bridge of intact bone adjacent to the intercondylar notch.
