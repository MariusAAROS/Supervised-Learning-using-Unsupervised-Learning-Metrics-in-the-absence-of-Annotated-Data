as a result ,. follow up home visits and other cross sector interventions , such as follow home arrangements and case managers have been quite regularly implemented on an experimental basis as a possible alternative to hospital based measures. studies show that readmission can be diminished by increased collaboration between hospital , district nurses and general practitioners [ 8 , 9 ]. follow up home visits by the district nurse and general practitioner to frail elderly patients after discharge have shown promising results [ 10 , 11 ]. the aim of follow up home visits to elderly and frail persons is to enable them to remain in their own home , avoid readmission to hospital , admission to nursing homes or other forms of sheltered housing and to improve the functional ability and general wellbeing of the elderly. these results are overall convincing and , as a result , on going work is being done by health authorities to test and further develop follow up home visits as an initiative , including a programme in copenhagen carried out from 20082011. approximately 100 follow up home visits to patients in the intervention group have been made. in the remaining approximately 200 cases in the intervention group it has not been possible to carry out a follow up home visit , first of all because gps could not meet the requirements. this paper will focus on the implementation of follow up home visits using a qualitative methodological approach.
