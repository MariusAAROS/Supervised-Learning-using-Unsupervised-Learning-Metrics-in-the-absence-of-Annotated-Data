ngal rises in response to prolonged hypobaric hypoxia ; marked increases in ngal may occur without concomitant arf and the degree of ngal rise at ha is associated with the presence or absence of ams. in neither scenario did ngal rise. that seen in trek 1 + 2 , ngal ( ng / ml , mean sd , range ) showed no change between baseline and 180 minutes : 63 26 ( 2980 ) versus 67 25 ( 2784 ) , p = 0.538. in the 22 subjects ascending to 1085 m in the uk. , there was no significant ( p = 0.084 ) rise in ngal following exercise : resting sl ngal was 64 11 ( ng / ml , mean sd , range 60104 ) and postexercise ngal was 71 14 ( ng / ml , mean sd , range 60100 ). acute mountain sickness ( ams ) occurs during exposure to high altitude ( ha ) and is a clinical syndrome characterised by headache , insomnia , malaise , and gastrointestinal symptoms. it is common , developing in 1030% at 25003000 meters and in up to 60% of those ascending to around 4500 meters. it causes significant morbidity and is a challenging clinical condition in remote environments.
