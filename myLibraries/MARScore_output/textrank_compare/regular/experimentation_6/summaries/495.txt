by varying the contact time ( 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , and 8 min ) while keeping all other parameters constant with respect to ph , temperature , and dose of na zeolite p1 , 0.25 gm , the influence of contact time on the zeolite capacity for different metal ions is shown in figure 5. removal efficiency increases for cadmium from 95 to 98% , for copper from 71 to 76% , for iron from 64 to 76% , and for cobalt from 58 to 61% as the time increases from 1 to 8 min.. figure 6 represents the variation in metal ion adsorption with time ; however the adsorption rate becomes slower with passage of time up to 4 min. the initial faster rate of removal of each metal ion may be due to the availability of the uncovered surface area of the adsorbents. for adsorption isotherms models. for adsorption isotherms models were used in this work , langmuir and freundlich isotherms. the nonlinear form of this model is expressed as ( 3)qe = kfce1/n , where kf is the freundlich constant ( mg / g)/(l / mg)1/n and also referred to as adsorption capacity , while n is the heterogeneity factor and related to adsorption intensity. is expressed as ( 7)tqt=1k2qe2+tqe , where k2 ( g / mgmin ) is the rate constant of second order adsorption. zeolite is a natural porous mineral described as hydrated aluminosilicates containing exchangeable alkali and earth alkaline cations ( na , k , ca , or mg ) and could be synthesised from the aluminium silicate materials as clay minerals and pumice by alkali attack [ 13 ]. zeolites have a large surface area , microporous structure , and high affinity for metal ions , providing an efficient scavenging pathway for heavy metals in toxic systems [ 4 , 5 ].
