completion rates were approximately 70% ( 68.6% for duloxetine treated patients , 72.3% for ssri treated patients , and 66.8% for placebo treated patients ). completion rates were approximately 70% ( 68.6% for duloxetine treated patients , 72.3% for ssri treated patients , and 66.8% for placebo treated patients ). duloxetine and ssri were comparable on most other efficacy measures ; however , duloxetine treated patients showed a greater mean change from baseline in hamd17 retardation subscale score compared with ssri treated patients ( least squares mean difference [ 95% ci ] ) duloxetine and ssri were comparable on most other efficacy measures ; however , duloxetine treated patients showed a greater mean change from baseline in hamd17 retardation subscale score compared with ssri treated patients ( least squares mean difference [ 95% ci ] ) discontinuation due to lack of efficacy was more likely in placebo treated patients than in duloxetine treated or ssri treated patients ( 13.3% versus 3.2% and 3.2% , respectively ). nausea ( 25.7% ) , dry mouth ( 17.3% ) , dizziness ( 12.6% ) , constipation ( 11.0% ) , and decreased appetite ( 11.9% ) had a higher incidence than in placebo treated patients , but the rates of these adverse events were similar between duloxetine treated and ssri treated patients except for nausea and dry mouth. discontinuation due to lack of efficacy was more likely in placebo treated patients than in duloxetine treated or ssri treated patients ( 13.3% versus 3.2% and 3.2% , respectively ).
