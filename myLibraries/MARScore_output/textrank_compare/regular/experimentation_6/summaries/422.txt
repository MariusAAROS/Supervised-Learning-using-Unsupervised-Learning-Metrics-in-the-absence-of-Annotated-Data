in 498 children for mri sedation. our study also demonstrated that the use of high dose dexmedetomidine as sole agent is effective for mri sedation. high dose dexmedetomidine is an attractive and effective medication in children for mri sedation. however , similar to ours , several other studies have reported trivial effect of dexmedetomidine on respiration [ 12 , 34 , 36 ] which is consistent with the notion that the risk of respiratory depression is minimal with careful dexmedetomidine sedation. however , this level of sedation will likely not be conducive to pediatric mri sedation , where higher doses of dexmedetomidine will be needed to accomplish the necessary sedation level. the success of sedation for mri has typically been measured by two factors : the safety of sedation procedure ( lack of adverse events ) and its effectiveness ( completion of diagnostic examination ). sedation is often required in young children in order to obtain good diagnostic cross sectional imaging like computed tomography scan ( ct scan ) and magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ).
