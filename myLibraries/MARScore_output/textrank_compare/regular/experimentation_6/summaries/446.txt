found elevated levels of vascular endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor in patients with liver cirrhosis , especially in those with spider nevi. an ultrasound abdomen was suggestive of liver cirrhosis with portal hypertension ( portal vein diameter of 14 mm ) , ascites and splenomegaly. thus , a diagnosis of cirrhosis liver with portal hypertension was made ( ctp9 , class b , and meld 11 ). we hereby report a case of very large spider nevus in a patient with hepatitis c virus ( hcv ) related liver cirrhosis. spider nevi are represented by telangiectases that consist of a large arteriole from which radiate numerous small vessels that resemble spider 's legs. spider nevi are usually < 2 cm in diameter and rarely grow to assume large size more than 2 cm. spider nevi can be seen in pregnancy , in patients with thyrotoxicosis , rheumatoid arthritis , oral contraceptive use and most commonly , liver cirrhosis.
