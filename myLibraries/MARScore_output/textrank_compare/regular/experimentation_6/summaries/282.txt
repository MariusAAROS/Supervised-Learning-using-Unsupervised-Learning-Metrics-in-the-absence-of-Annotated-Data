external supports such as motion sensors could be used to enhance computer vision based fall detection method , and a data fusion algorithm can operate the validation and correlation among the two subsystems to raise robust performance of fall detection. as the compact wearable device requires low power consumption and a single triaxial accelerometer could provide effective information , threshold based fall detection algorithm will be used in this system. cameras are distributed at limited space to offer pictures or videos of human activities to implement fall detection algorithm. falls of the elderly always lead to serious health issues as the decline of their physical fitness. fracture is the most common injury in fall of an elderly and there is also a certain possibility to get coma , brain trauma , and paralysis. at most fall situations , the fall process is the main source of injury because of the high impact. but sometimes the late medical salvage may worsen the situation.
