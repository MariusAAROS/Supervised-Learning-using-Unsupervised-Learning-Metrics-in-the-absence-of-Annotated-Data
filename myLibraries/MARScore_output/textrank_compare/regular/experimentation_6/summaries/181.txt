sacubitril / valsartan is a combination of a neprilysin inhibitor and an angiotensin ii receptor blocker , indicated to decrease the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure in patients with chronic heart failure.a patient previously stable on atorvastatin developed severe rhabdomyolysis and an elevation of transaminases within 26 days of initiation of sacubitril / valsartan.. rhabdomyolysis is a syndrome characterized by skeletal muscle cell damage , leading to elevated creatine kinase ( ck ) , lactate dehydrogenase ( ldh ) , and aspartate aminotranferase ( ast ) , which can result in severe sequelae , including renal failure , cardiac arrhythmia , hyperthermia and death. in these patients , the choice of statin dose , and using a statin for cardiovascular risk reduction benefit , must be weighed against adverse effects , drug drug interactions , precautions and contraindications to statin therapy. future reports of this reaction may help to define high risk patients , but it should be noted that our patient had no known high risk characteristics for the development of rhabdomyolysis , except for prior mild elevations of ck during hospitalizations for chf exacerbations. clinically , rhabdomyolysis classically presents with muscle pain , weakness and dark , red or tea colored urine ; however , less than 10% of patients will demonstrate all three components of this triad. subgroups of patients at greater risk of statin associated muscle pathology have been identified and include age > 70 years , impaired renal function , and impaired hepatic function. entresto is a combination of sacubitril , a neprilysin inhibitor , and valsartan , an angiotensin ii receptor blocker ( arb ) , indicated to decrease the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure in patients with chronic heart failure ( new york heart association [ nyha ] class ii. sacubitril / valsartan has not been associated with rhabdomyolysis and is commonly used in patients who are also receiving statin therapy.
