this benefit has been shown in remote based cardiac exercise programs where the use of transtelephonic exercise monitoring ( tem ) has been used to relieve patients ' and trainers ' anxiety during exercise [ 3234 ]. negative comments included worried [ remote pulse oximeter ] could dislodge during vigorous exercise ( n = 5 ) , remote pulse oximeter was uncomfortable ( n = 4 ) , and audio or video quality was jumpy ( n = 3 ). it was hypothesised that remote pulse oximetry would not only be technically feasible but would also be valid when compared to conventional units and would be easy for participants to use. the validity of remote pulse oximetry was assessed by comparing the remote measurements ( therapist data ) with conventional face to face measurements ( participant data ). our pilot study demonstrated that remote pulse oximetry was feasible , and the data transmission method produced valid data at the remote end when compared with conventional face to face measures. a favourable result will enable the development of remote pulmonary rehabilitation programs for people living in rural or remote areas. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( copd ) is a progressive lung disease which is characterized by airway obstruction and lung parenchyma destruction.
