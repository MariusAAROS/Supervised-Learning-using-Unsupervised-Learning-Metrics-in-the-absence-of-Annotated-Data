the homemade three channel , single port system using a surgical glove and an alexis wound retractor offers reliable , flexible , and cost effective access for single port procedures , and the system can be applicable in nonarticulated , rigid , conventional laparoscopic instruments [ 16 , 17 ]. although single port surgery enhances cosmetic benefits and reduces postoperative pain and morbidity , use of this technique was not widespread due to technical difficulties. particularly , single port surgery is ideal for laparoscopic assisted vaginal hysterectomy ( lavh ) because the vagina of woman can be considered as an additional route for surgery ; thus , uterine manipulators can be applied through the vagina [ 1117 ]. spa lavh is a technically safe and feasible procedure , and the homemade single port system offers reliable and cost effective access for single port surgery. as mentioned earlier , lavh is most ideal for single port surgery because the vagina of woman can be considered as an additional route for surgery ; thus , uterine manipulators can be applied through the vagina. limitations of single port surgery include the loss of instrumental triangulation , reduced operative working space , reduced laparoscopic visualization , and instrumental crowding and clashing. our observations show that a history of abdominopelvic surgery is not a contraindication for single port surgery ; however , central obesity is problematic to secure a route for the single port system through a small intraumbilical incision.
