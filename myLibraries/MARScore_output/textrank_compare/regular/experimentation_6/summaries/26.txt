in addition , the matrix protects the biofilm cells from various microbicidal agents and stresses , including dehydration , toxins , ultraviolet light , chemical disinfectants , temperature and osmotic shock , and lead them to increased resistance against antimicrobials 9 , 10. to address the limited efficacy of existing antibiotics in the treatment of established bacterial biofilms , novel approaches are required to prevent bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation 11. in the event of bacterial adhesion to an implant ,. bacterial adhesion to surfaces can be divided into a first , reversible phase and a second , irreversible phase. in fact , some polymer coatings , like the hydrophilic polymethacrylic acid , polyethylene oxide or protein resistant polyethylene glycol can be applied to the surface of titanium implants and result in significant inhibition of bacterial adhesion 19 22. several studies have recently shown the ability of ha to protect against various infectious agents 30 , depending on ha concentration and molecular weight 31 , 32 , while more recently ha interference on bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation has been extensively investigated 33. aim of this review is to provide an update of the current evidence concerning ha ability to reduce / prevent bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation. nearly two decades ago , pavesio et al. 34 were probably the first to describe the ability of ha to resist bacterial adhesion , with particular reference to staphylococcus epidermidis , and its non fouling properties 35 , proposing coated polymeric medical devices ( e.g. , intraocular lenses , stents and catheters ) to reduce implant related infections.
