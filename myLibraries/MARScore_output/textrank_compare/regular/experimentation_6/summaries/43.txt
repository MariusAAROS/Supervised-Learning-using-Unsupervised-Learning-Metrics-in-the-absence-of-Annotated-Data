the block diagram of figure 1 shows our global approach for updating preoperative images using successive imr images acquired at different critical points during surgery. though , commercial igns systems allow one to register preoperative images and successive imr images , but in a rigid way only. this paper presents a complete 3d framework for updating multimodal preoperative images with respect to surgical brain deformations , due to brain shift and successive resections , followed and quantified using imr images. we take into account successive deformations based on a linear elastic biomechanical model which is deformed using fem or xfem , depending on the type of deformation occurring between the pair of imr images under consideration , namely , brain shift or resection. imr images thus have to be rigidly coregistered to take into account this potential rigid motion. the segmentation of imr images into specific regions , for example , healthy brain and tumor regions , is first performed manually using 3d slicer ( http://www.slicer.org/ ) and then smoothed to minimize the dependance of the results on segmentation roughness. in this section , we apply our methods , respectively , of brain shift and resection ( imr images are acquired with the 0.5 tesla intraoperative ge signa scanner of the brigham and women 's hospital , boston , usa. imr image size is 256 256 60 voxels , and voxel size is 0.9375 0.9375 2.5 mm ).
