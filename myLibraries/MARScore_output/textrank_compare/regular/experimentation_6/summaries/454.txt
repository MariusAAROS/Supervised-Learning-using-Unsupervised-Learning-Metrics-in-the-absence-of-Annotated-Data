the temporal resolution is already reasonably high for monitoring lung tumour motion in real time.. after successful tests in volunteers , dynamic mri was transferred to patients with solitary pulmonary tumours in order to visualise lung tumour motion by mri in two dimensions ( fig. maximum lung tumour motion ( mm ) during shallow breathing in cranio caudal ( cc ) , medio lateral ( ml ) and antero posterior ( ap ) direction depending on tumour localization in the upper , middle or lower lung zone.. top row , 2d truefisp sequence ; middle row , 3d flash sequence with a temporal resolution of one volume data set per second ; bottom row , volume segmentation of lung and tumour from the 3d flash data set. lung motion is reflected by measuring the distance from the apex to the top of the diaphragm ( l ). pulmonary nodules and lung tumours move substantially during respiration with significant differences according to the tumour localization. respiratory tumour motion is a big challenge for radiotherapy , especially for high precision techniques. an additional target dose escalation which is deemed necessary for a curative approach of lung cancer is limited as so far as tumour motion is not sufficiently quantified and integrated into modern treatment planning.
