to elucidate changes in genetic expression induced by exposure to nir irradiation that simulates solar nir radiation that reaches human eye tissues , dna microarray analysis was carried out using rna isolated from control and nir irradiated corneal epithelial cells. the findings here that egfr expression is significantly upregulated following exposure of corneal epithelial cells to nir irradiation support that solar nir radiation that reaches human tissues can induce corneal cell injury. nir irradiation simulating solar nir radiation that reaches human tissues induced upregulated expression of egfr in human corneal cells. corneal epithelium responds rapidly to injury , wherein wound healing occurs by cells migrating as a sheet to cover the defect and reestablish barrier functions.21 in wounded cornea , the epithelium plays a central role , not only as a key cell type in corneal repair , but also as a growth factor source.22 as in other tissues , several growth factors are suggested to play a role in regulating corneal epithelial function and wound healing.21,23 following nir irradiation that simulates solar radiation , microarray analysis of corneal epithelial cell dna in this study showed that egfr was highly expressed , and statistically significant upregulation of egfr variants 1 and 3 was observed ( p<0.05 ) by quantitative real time pcr. corneal epithelium like structure was used to simulate the human eye , and we evaluated dna microarray and real time polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) analysis results from normal human corneal epithelial cells exposed to water filtered broad spectrum nir irradiation to simulate solar nir radiation that reaches the eye. near infrared ( nir ) radiation can penetrate the skin and the sclera of the eye. the high permeability of nir radiation also allows it to affect tissues deeper within the eye , such as muscles , the lens , and retina.
