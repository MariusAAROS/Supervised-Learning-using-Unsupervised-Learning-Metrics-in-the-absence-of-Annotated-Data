clinically , the persistence of a uterus and fallopian tubes leads to either cryptorchidism or inguinal hernia depending on whether or not mullerian derivatives can be mobilized during testicular descent. it is characterized by the persistence of the uterus , fallopian tubes and upper vagina in otherwise normally virilized boys. exploration of the inguinal canal revealed an indirect inguinal hernia containing a globular structure resembling uterus , fallopian tubes with an atrophic right testis embedded in the broad ligament and attached to pelvis with a thick fibrous band [ figs. total excision of the uterus with fallopian tubes and we report the case of a 70 year old man with unilateral cryptorchidism on the right side and left obstructed inguinal hernia containing uterus and fallopian tube ( that is , hernia uteri inguinalis ; type i male form of pmds ) coincidentally detected during an operation for an obstructed left inguinal hernia with right cryptorchidism. the male form is encountered in 8090% of cases , characterized by unilateral cryptorchidism with contralateral inguinal hernia , and can be one of the two types : the first type is hernia uteri inguinalis , which is characterized by one descended testis and herniation of the ipsilateral corner of uterus and fallopian tube into the inguinal canal. pmds is a rare form of male pseudo hermaphroditism characterized by the presence of mullerian duct structures in an otherwise phenotypically , as well as genotypically , normal man.
