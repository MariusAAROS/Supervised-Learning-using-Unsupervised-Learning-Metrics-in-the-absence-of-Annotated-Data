figure 1a shows this behavior in terms of the growth of the population ( change in population density with respect to time ) versus the population density. ( 1 ) describes the change in the population density over time and is tied into a genetic subsystem that allows the organismal response to population density to evolve in terms of the selection gradient and genetic variance. figure 1a shows this behavior in terms of the growth of the population ( change in population density with respect to time ) versus the population density. ( 1 ) describes the change in the population density over time and is tied into a genetic subsystem that allows the organismal response to population density to evolve in terms of the selection gradient and genetic variance. if the rate of evolution is fast enough , the allee threshold can fall below the population density , causing the rate of change of population density to become positive ( where u > a ) and the population grows and can successfully invade. in addition to the time evolution of population density across space in figs 4 and 5 , the evolution of the mean trait value across space illustrates how gene flow and the density dependent selection gradient influences its rate of change and distribution ( figs 4c and 5c ). population density of a diffusion dispersed population across one dimensional space.
