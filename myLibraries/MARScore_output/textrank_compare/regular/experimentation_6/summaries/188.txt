cardiovascular reactivity was calculated as the difference between the average baseline prestressor blood pressure and the average change in blood pressure over the 5minute stress period. two participants did not complete the cold pressor stressor ; thus , the sample size is 48 for the cold pressor cardiovascular reactivity and 50 for the anger recall cardiovascular reactivity. cardiovascular reactivity was defined as the change in cardiovascular parameters ( sbp , dbp , mean arterial pressure ( map ) , and heart rate ( hr ) ) the variable selection results of the stepwise algorithm suggested the use of state anxiety for a parsimonious model of both cold pressor cardiovascular reactivity as well as anger recall cardiovascular reactivity. our next step was to evaluate regression models to predict cardiovascular reactivity with state anxiety as the independent variable. similar results were found with the model for predicting the change in cardiovascular reactivity for the ar stressor as shown in table 4. this study investigated whether anxiety differentially affects cardiovascular reactivity to cold pressor and anger recall stress tests in a sample of young , healthy , community dwelling african american adults , a population prone to develop cardiovascular disease.
