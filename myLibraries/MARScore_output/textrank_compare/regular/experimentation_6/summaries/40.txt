the mid trachea level was calculated from tracheal length and the ideal position of ett is shown in fig. this study showed that mid tracheal level could be estimated by the surface distance between the cc and the ssn ( extcc ssn ). the endotracheal tube ( ett ) should be placed at the optimal level to avoid inadvertent complication. there are many methods for determining the appropriate depth of ett in adults ; fixed insertion depth according to sex ( 23 and 21 cm from the upper incisors in adult males and females , respectively ) , the use of depth marks on the ett , suprasternal palpation of the ett tip or cuff , and bilateral auscultation. cc = cricoid cartilage , ett = endotracheal tube , msj = manubriosternal juction , mtl = the level of the middle of the trachea , ssn = suprasternal notch , vc = vocal cord. in clinical practice , physicians can use extcc ssn to determine the depth of ett so that the segment between the proximal edge of the cuff and the ett tip lies at the mid tracheal level. evron et al used the sum of the 2 distances from the mouth angle to the jaw angle and from the jaw angle to the sternal manubrium to determine the depth of ett..
