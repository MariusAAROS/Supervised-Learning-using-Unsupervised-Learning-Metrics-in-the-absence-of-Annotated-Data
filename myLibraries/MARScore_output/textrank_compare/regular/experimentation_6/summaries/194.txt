we therefore decided to evaluate various combination chemotherapy regimens as first line chemotherapy for acc. a total of 537 acc patients were treated with first line chemotherapy for advanced disease at samsung medical center ( seoul , korea ). patients who had a poor performance status ( 2 in ecog scale ) were significantly less likely to respond to first line chemotherapy ( 24% vs. 50% ; p<0.01 ) compared to those with an ecog performance status of 0 or 1. response rate was not significantly influenced by age , gender , prior treatments , baseline laboratory parameters , metastatic sites , or chemotherapy regimen. despite recent advances in the treatment of acc , patients treated with first line chemotherapy have a median os rarely exceeding 24 months. because bevacizumab was only recently made available in korea as first line chemotherapy , only 29 patients received bevacizumab. the recent integration of oxaliplatin and irinotecan for the management of acc patients has extended median os in a meaningful way. folfiri patients discontinued therapy due to progression ( n=60 ) , physician 's recommendation or patient withdrawal ( n=13 ) , toxicity ( n=20 ) , or unknown causes ( n=2 ).
