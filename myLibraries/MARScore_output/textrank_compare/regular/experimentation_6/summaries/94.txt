in iga nephropathy , asma expression in interstitium is related to damaged renal function and progression of disease. to our best knowledge , this is the first morphometrical study of the correlation of asma expression in gn and renal function at the time of biopsy. asma expression was analyzed by indirect immunohistochemistry ( envision / hrp system ( dako , denmark ) using mouse monoclonal anti alpha smooth muscle antibody ( asma / hrp dako , denmark ). all foci of asma expression in the interstitium ( including atrophic tubules ) , as well as the perimeter of histological slide , were measured in m at 100 magnification ; their ratio was calculated as a percentage of asma expression in interstitium. area of asma expression in each glomerulus was measured in m at 400 magnification and added together for all glomeruli ( figure 1a ). their ratio was calculated as a percentage of asma expression in glomeruli ( figure 1b ). asma expression was analyzed by indirect immunohistochemistry ( envision / hrp system ( dako , denmark ) using mouse monoclonal anti alpha smooth muscle antibody ( asma / hrp dako , denmark ).
