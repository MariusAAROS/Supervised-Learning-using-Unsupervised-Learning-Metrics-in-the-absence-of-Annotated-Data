traditional bivad implantation as bridge to transplant as a short term solution was not an option due to severe mitral valve stenosis from the atrial mass and mitral valve infiltration. during the course of 12 months , the patient was in a clinically stable state with combined mild mitral valve regurgitation and stenosis and good left ventricular pump function , with ejection fraction ( ef ) 63%. there is no valid data on the benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapy on malignant cardiac soft tissue sarcomas.. limitations of radiotherapy are cardiac sensitivity to radiation injury and adverse effects on global cardiac functions. arrhythmias can develop from intraatrial invasion , which can also lead to massive pericardial effusion and tamponade. if the tumor mass is located in the left atrium or ventricle , embolic infarction might occur. a 55year old man presented signs of progressive cardiac decompensation during the last 4 months due to tumorous obstruction of the mitral valve. in 2014 the patient underwent resection of a suspected myxoma ( 824124 mm ) in the left atrium.
