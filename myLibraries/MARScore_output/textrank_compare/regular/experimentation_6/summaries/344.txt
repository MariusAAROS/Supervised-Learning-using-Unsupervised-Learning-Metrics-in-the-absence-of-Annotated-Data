this analysis has been used to group the different sources from where the bacteria were recovered using the frequency of antibiotics resistance. it is part of a surveillance system aiming at monitoring emerging antibiotic resistant bacteria and their widespread. isolation of antibiotic resistant bacteria from aquaculture products and aquaculture environment indicates the health risk associated with the aquaculture. thus , any source of antibiotic resistant bacteria must be carefully monitored. low frequency of antibiotic resistant bacteria may indicate the less activity associated with the contamination of antibiotics in the area. banning of antibiotics has aided in reducing the number of antibiotic resistant bacteria in an environment. in their study suggested that antibiotic resistant bacteria in mariculture farm may be transported by water current which flows from surrounding farms that utilize antibiotics excessively.
