treatment of median clefts depends on the clinical presentation and may vary from simple alignment of orbicularis oris and vermilion , to reconstruction of the cupid 's bow and philtrum for true median clefts , and complex craniofacial procedures in case of false median clefts. median cleft face syndrome , frontonasal dysplasia , and tessier 0 clefts are various terms used to describe abnormalities associated with true median clefts that are not accompanied by forebrain abnormalities. median clefts are broadly classified into true and false ; false clefts are due to agenesis of the medial nasal process , while true clefts are due to failure of the medial nasal process to fuse. in 1937 , veau categorized median clefts to notch of the lip , median cleft extending to the columella , and defects due to atrophy of the midline facial structures. pfeifer incisions can successfully provide mucosal length , vermilion fullness , and lip symmetry in patients with moderate median cleft lip. craniofacial defects are rare , disfiguring facial anomalies , with an incidence of about 1.4 to 4.9 cases per 100,000 live births. craniofacial clefts may be caused by failure of the maxillary processes to fuse , external pressure , amniotic bands , oligohydramnios , central disorganization of the neural crest , and hematomas.
