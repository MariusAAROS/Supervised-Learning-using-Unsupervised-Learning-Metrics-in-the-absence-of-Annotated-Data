the product formed was filtered off and washed with water , dried , and recrystallized from ethanol.. identical reaction condition was followed when 1aza1,3butadienes and oximes were used as reactants. most of these methodologies suffer from serious drawbacks like involvement of strong lewis and bronsted acids , use of toxic and costly transition metals ( i.e. , cr , pd , co ) , low temperature , longer reaction time , low yield , and difficulties in isolating the products.. , a number of chemical reactions such as diels alder , hetero diels alder , 1,3dipolar cycloaddition , oxidations , reductions , and others are performed successfully in water [ 13 ]. the surfactant , due to its hydrophobic and hydrophilic nature , forms micelles with water insoluble organic compounds and promote the desired reactions to occur inside the hydrophobic ambience of the micelle core [ 9 , 10 ]. using water as solvent in the organic reactions is one of the most important targets to organic chemists because of the easy availability , nontoxicity , and ecofriendly nature of the water [ 17 ]. in this endeavour. also , it is reported that in few cases addition of the water increases the rate and the yield of a reaction and also enhances the enantioselectivity in a chiral synthesis.
