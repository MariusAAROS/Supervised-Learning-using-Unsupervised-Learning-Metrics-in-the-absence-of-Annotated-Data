many studies have shown that bracket debonding can cause enamel loss , particularly when the fracture occurs at the enamel adhesive interface.. the same bracket was bonded with self adhesive composite cement ( maxcem elite , kerr , usa ). reported that self adhesive cements had satisfactory bond strength to dentin and restorative materials , but that their bond strength to enamel was weak. enamel damage may be in the form of enamel cracks , which may propagate during debonding [ 13 ]. the aim of the current study was to assess the enamel cracks after debonding of brackets bonded with two different adhesive systems and also to evaluate enamel cracks after removing adhesive remnants and enamel polishing. the number of enamel cracks and the length and direction of each crack were assessed with the aid of adobe photoshop cs software ( adobe systems incorporate , usa ) ( figure 1 ). enamel cracks before bracket bonding ( a ) , after deboning ( b ) and after polishing ( c ).
