in the ileal pouch anal anastomosis group separately , the content of monounsaturated fatty acid in feces was positively correlated to dietary intake of monounsaturated fatty acids in particular. this may deteriorate cholesterol metabolism , as absorption of cholesterol in duodenum and jejunum requires micellar solubilization with bile acids , fatty acids , monoglycerides , and phospholipids. furthermore , the fecal amount and composition of fatty acids reflect fat ingestion , intestinal fatty acid absorption , and the activity of colonic bacteria. although some of the discrepancies between studies may be due to the use of different methods to analyze fatty acids , differences in diet , or the fact that assessments have been performed in different body compartments , modifications in the metabolism of fatty acids have been suggested in cancer patients [ 5 , 6 ]. the results describe the content of fatty acids in feces , and relate this to the proportions of fatty acids and levels of cyclooxygenase mrna expression in duodenal biopsies , diet , and levels of serum lipoproteins. previous familial adenomatous polyposis studies have focused upon faecal sterols and bile acids [ 1517 ] , but none has to the best of our knowledge analysed the content of fatty acids in feces , including very long chained fatty acids. total cholesterol were negatively correlated to the content of palmitic acid ( r = 0.7 , p =.03 ) , palmitoleic acid ( r = 0.7 , p =.02 ) , stearic acid ( r = 0.7 , p =.02 ) , oleic acid ( r = 0.7 , p =.02 ) , linoleic acid ( r = 0.8 , p =.002 ) , and monounsaturated fatty acids ( r = 0.7 , p =.02 ) in feces.
