fop is an extremely rare and most crippling form of heterotopic ossification in humans with an incidence of 1 in 2 millions. trauma as trivial as intramuscular injections , mandibular block during dental procedures , muscle fatigue , muscle trauma due to bumps , falls and influenza like illness can aggravate the process of heterotopic ossification in these patients. heterotopic ossification is heralded by the rapid appearance of large painful swellings of highly vascular fibro proliferative tissue involving tendons , ligaments , fascia , and skeletal muscle. this condition needs to be differentiated from progressive osseous hyperplasia ( poh ) , which presents with heterotopic ossification. poh is distinguished from fop by the absence of congenital skeletal malformations , the absence of predictable regional patterns of heterotopic ossification , the pre dominance of intramembranous rather than endochondral ossification , and the presence of heterotopic ossification in skin and subcutaneous fat. , dorsomorphin has been identified as a powerful orally available signal transduction inhibitor of bmp signaling and preliminary data suggest that this category of stis may play a powerful role in inhibiting heterotopic ossification in animal models but its safety and efficacy in animal models of fop is still to be determined. fop demands further research to treat individuals suffering from this dreaded form of heterotopic ossification.
