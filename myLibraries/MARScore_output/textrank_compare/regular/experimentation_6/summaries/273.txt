other studies have demonstrated that mps of endothelial origin induce the expression of endothelial cyclooxygenase type 2 , different adhesion molecules , release of cytokines , and impaired release of nitric oxide from vascular endothelial cells. mps isolated from granulation tissue are derived from endothelial cells , monocytes , platelets , erythrocytes [ 913 ] , and myofibroblasts. emps are small vesicles that are released from endothelial cells and can be found circulating in the blood. recently , it has been shown that p38 mitogen activated protein kinase ( mapk ) is a critical molecule in the production of proinflammatory emps and increased icam1 production by endothelial cells , providing a paracrine loop to enhance the endothelial response to inflammation. have shown that the proinflammatory agent , tnf , activates endothelial cells and induces release of emps ( figure 2 ). thrombin modulates tissue repair responses by altering vascular permeability , stimulating endothelial cell , fibroblast , and neutrophil migration , and promoting their spreading and adhesion. recent studies by sapet et al. have shown that release of emps by endothelial cells in response to thrombin involves a group of genes that regulate angiogenesis and are linked to the cytoskeleton reorganization family.
