however , it is recommended that , during cpb , blood stagnation in the circuit be avoided because the rapid cleavage of bivalirudin may result in thrombosis. the ecmo circuit is devoid of a reservoir , and therefore blood stagnation is usually not a circuit related problem. conversely , under some circumstances , the cardiac chambers may act as a ' natural reservoir ' , which entails blood stagnation and the risk for spontaneous intracardiac thrombosis. intracardiac thrombus formation during ecmo with heparin anticoagulation has been described as well , but the pharmacokinetic properties of heparin may limit the risk of thrombus formation due to blood stagnation. this is particularly true in the case of a very large right or left atrium with insufficient venous drainage or the case of very poor ventricular systolic function with intraventricular blood stagnation. , we think that maintaining a partial ecmo support , leaving a minimal degree of intracardiac blood flow , may be a reasonable choice. this may be checked by echocardiographic view of heart valve movement or simply by the observation of some degree of pulsatile arterial blood pressure.
