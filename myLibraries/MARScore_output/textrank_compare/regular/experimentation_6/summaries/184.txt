stepwise backward multiple linear regression analysis was performed in order to study the relationship between milk intake in quintiles and body height ( cm ) after adjustments for sex , birth weight ( g ) , father 's and mother 's height ( cm ) , bmi , tanner stage ( 15 ) , and ses. the studied exposure variables in this model were milk intake in quintiles and the lct c > t13910 polymorphism , and the outcome variable was body height. main effect by quintiles of milk intake and lct13910 c > t ( exposure variables ) on body height in swedish preadolescents and adolescents ( n=542 ) we found that milk intake and lct c > t13910 polymorphism , known to modulate milk consumption , were significant contributors to the observed variance of body height in the studied population. our study accounts for parental height as regards milk intake and its potential effects on body height and growth in preadolescents and adolescents. we conclude that actual milk intake and the genetic lp trait is positively associated with body height in preadolescents and adolescents. for four subjects , data for ses. student 's t test was used to determine differences in milk intake ( g / d ) between lp and lnp subjects.
