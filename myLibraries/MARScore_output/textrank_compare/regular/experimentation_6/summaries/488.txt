, there was an increase in fa , as has been observed previously in rats and non human primates , however , usually soon after permanent rather than transient occlusion ( kim et al. , 2013 ; liu et al. , 2007 ; yang et al. , 1999 ). the fa increase became a decrease that persisted at subacute and chronic time points , confirming previous reports of a reduced fa commonly observed in damaged brain post stroke ( e.g. kim et al. , 2013 ; liu et al. , 2007 ; yang et al. , 1999 ). adc alterations reported previously are comparable to those observed presently ( e.g. lama et al. , 2011 ; liu et al. , 2007 ). ( brennan et al. , 2013 ; liu et al. , 2013 ; qin et al. , 2012 ). a differential timing of dti alterations is also expected considering direct ischemic injury is thought to be followed by a delayed wallerian degeneration ( lama et al. , 2011 ; tuor et al. , 2013 ). it is currently clear that at chronic times , fa is superior to adc or other standard imaging methods such as t2 imaging because lesions detected with these other sequences tended to pseudo normalize at times post insult ( lama et al. , 2011 ; tuor et al. ,. inadequate blood flow to the brain , termed cerebral ischemia , will produce brain injury and a progression of pathophysiological responses associated with energy depletion that include cell swelling , cytotoxic edema , vasogenic edema and if sufficiently severe or prolonged , neuronal cell death.
