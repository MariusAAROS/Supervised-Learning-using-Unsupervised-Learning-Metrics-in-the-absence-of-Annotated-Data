a logical method to promote internalization of nanoparticles is to modify their surface with a ligand such as folic acid which can be efficiently taken up by cells through receptor mediated endocytosis.23 folic acid binds to the folate receptors at cell surfaces with very high affinity and is internalized by receptor mediated endocytosis.24,26 more importantly , folic acid is stable , poorly immunogenic , and has the ability to target cancer cells preferentially because the folate receptor is frequently overexpressed on the surface of cancer cells. it binds to negatively charged phospholipid surfaces with a higher specificity for phosphatidylserine , a membrane phospholipid , than for most other phospholipids.21 in apoptotic cells , phosphatidylserine is translocated from the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane to the outer leaflet , thereby exposing phosphatidylserine to the exter nal environment.22 a facsaria ( bd cor poration , bedford , ma ) flow cytometer was used for analysis of the cells.. a recent report nanoparticles by cells suggested that the uptake of fe3o4 could be quantitatively measured using flow cytometric light scatter.6 annexin v binding was performed using an annexinv fitc kit ( bd corporation ) as described by the manufacturer. cells in the late stages of apoptosis are located in the bottom right quadrant of the dot plot as double positive annexin v fitc and propidium iodide binding cells because , at this stage , the cell membranes are damaged and propidium iodide has penetrated into the cell. this modification can be used for successful targeting of cancer cells expressing the folate receptor. we demonstrated that magnetic fe3o4 nanoparticles coupled with folic acid can inhibit tumor proliferation and induce apoptosis of cancer cells in a dose and time dependent manner. apoptosis , or programmed cell death , is an active process characterized by cytoplasmic shrinkage , chromatin condensation , nuclear fragmentation , and activation of caspases.13 in addition , phosphatidylserine is exposed on the external surface of the cell in the early phase of apoptosis , and this exposure precedes membrane damage and dna fragmentation.15 on the other hand , necrosis is passive , and is characterized by cell swelling , rupture of the plasma membrane , and cell lysis , with leakage of cytoplasmic components , such as lactate dehydrogenase.13 in the present study , folic acid was coupled on the surface of fe3o4 for selective binding to cancer cells and immobilized on the surfaces of magnetic nanoparticles , to disperse particles and improve their cell internalization and target cancer cells , respectively. one strategy to realize efficient and specific cellular uptake of nanoparticles is to modify the nanoparticle surface with a ligand that is efficiently taken up by target cells via receptor mediated endocytosis.18 the objective of this research was to assess the potential effects of fe3o4 magnetic nanoparticles modified with ma fol on 5rp7 cancer cells and nih/3t3 cells.
