triceps skin fold ( tsf ) and mid arm circumference ( mac ) of centenarians in the lowest bmi classification averaged below the 5th percentile for females 80 + years in usa based on 20032006 nhanes data.. both parameters increased with bmi classification in a stepwise manner ( data not shown ) and were highly correlated with bmi ( pearson correlation coefficient between bmi and tsf = 0.482 ; and between bmi and mac = 0.624 ; p <.0001 for both ).. there were no differences according to bmi classification with regard to history of cvd , cancer , stroke , depression , or past or current tobacco use. finally , associations between bmi classifications and chronic health conditions were determined in a series of logistic regression analyses that included either bmi 20 or bmi 25 as an independent variable ( table 4 ). to decrease testing burden for participants , dietary intake data focused on frequency of intake of specific food groups selected based on the dietary guidelines for americans and age related associations with nutritional deficiencies and chronic diseases [ 16 , 17 ].. notably , we observed that based on frequency of intake and regardless of bmi classification , a large percentage of centenarians were not meeting the dietary guidelines for many food groups , with the exception of green and orange / yellow vegetables.. however , almost twice as many underweight centenarians lived in skilled nursing facilities as compared to the community , and there was no association between low bmi and dietary groups after controlling for race , residence , and gender.. thus , associations in centenarians between low bmi and dietary status may be quite complex and influenced considerably by place of residence. after controlling for demographic covariates , a strong association remained between low bmi and anemia but not with other health conditions and indicators.
