although many adrs are recognized during the drug development process and before licensing , this is not always the case , especially when they are uncommon or rare.3 moreover , patients with severe cognitive impairment may not be able to refer symptoms related to an adr , making the recognition of this clinical condition a medical problem.4 rhabdomyolysis is a clinical and laboratory syndrome that is caused by various etiologies , involving the skeletal muscle.5 rhabdomyolysis is characterized by the leaking of myoglobin and other intracellular proteins and electrolytes into the circulation , and may be associated with a wide variety of diseases , injuries , medications , and toxins.5 it is important to recognize drug induced rhabdomyolysis because clinical effects are usually reversible.4 rhabdomyolysis related to macrolide statin interaction has previously been described.68 clarithromycin , like other macrolides , is an inhibitor of cyp450 3a4 , the major enzyme responsible for the metabolism of several drugs , in particular some statins like simvastatin and atorvastain.69 to date , rhabdomyolysis related to clarithromycin has been reported in only one previous case report.10 we report the case of a 90year old caucasian male , admitted to the university hospital of pisa for dyspnea , who experienced rhabdomyolysis related to clarithromycin treatment. body temperature was 36.6c with normal systemic blood pressure ( 140/80 mmhg ) , diuresis , and blood oxygen saturation ( so2% 96.2% ). a diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis was made and clarithromycin was stopped , while the concomitant therapy with ceftriaxone , bisoprolol , and aerosol with salbutamol and oxitropium was continued. clarithromycin , like other macrolides , is an inhibitor of cyp450 3a4 , the major enzyme responsible for the metabolism of several drugs , in particular some statins as simvastatin and atorvastatin.3,69 rhabdomyolysis related to macrolide and statins interaction has previously been described ; however , rhabdomyolysis related to clarithromycin has been reported in only one previous case report.8,10 in our case , there was an evident temporal sequence between clarithromycin exposure withdrawal and the onset recovery from rhabdomyolysis biochemical signs , while other potential causes of muscle damage were reasonably excluded. moreover , an interaction with other concomitant medications was improbable considering the rapid resolution after clarithromycin withdrawal and the elimination pathways of the concomitant drugs ( both bisoprolol and ceftriaxone have hepatic and renal elimination routes).11,12 in addition , bisoprolol was administered at the minimal dose ( 1.25 mg ) and both bisoprolol and ceftriaxone , as single therapy , were never related to an adverse drug reaction like rhabdomyolysis. if rhabdomyolysis had been caused by the infection we would have expected that serum ck increased earlier , thus being already evident at hospital admission. the diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis , unless there is a high index of suspicion , can be missed since muscular pain , swelling , and tenderness may not be prominent or even absent.
