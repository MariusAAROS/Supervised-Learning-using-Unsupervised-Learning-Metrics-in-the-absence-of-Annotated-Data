further , a combination of pulmonary endarteritis with a systemic suppuration in chd invites greater attention. a rudimentary rv type of ventricle is also visualized echocardiography ( subcostal anatomically corrected view ) showing aorta arising from a rudimentary right ventricle which is connected to the left ventricle through a nonrestrictive foramen ( a ) and ( b ) shows the pulmonary vegetation suggesting pulmonary endarteritis ct scan of the brain showing bilateral cerebral abscesses the child was started on parenteral ceftriaxone. pulmonary endarteritis as an entity of right sided endocarditis is rare , even in patients of congenital heart disease. there are less than 30 reported cases of pulmonary endarteritis associated with pda in the adult , and overall incidence has dramatically decreased over the last 30 years. bilge et al. , in their case report of pulmonary endarteritis in pda , underlines the importance of echocardiography in not only making this rare diagnosis but also as an effective means of following up such a case. apart from pda , a single report exists of pulmonary endarteritis occurring after anatomical correction of complete transposition of the great arteries. to the best of our knowledge and available resources , our case report of pulmonary endarteritis in a child of single ventricle is probably the first such so far.
