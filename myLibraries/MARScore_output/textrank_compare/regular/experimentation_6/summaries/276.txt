incidence ( cases per 1,000 admissions ) of human listeriosis and serotype distribution of all isolates , national taiwan university hospital , taipei , taiwan , 19962008. patient distribution and incidence of human listeriosis , by age group , national taiwan university hospital , taipei , taiwan , 19962008. all of the patients with listeriosis lived in northern taiwan , and no obvious geographic correlation was observed between listeriosis patients in each year. we found that mortality was related to hepatic decompensation and effective antimicrobial drug therapy after culture results were reported. we reviewed the medical records of patients who had l. monocytogenes isolated from blood and body fluids from sterile sites during 19962008 at the national taiwan university hospital ( ntuh ) , a 2,500bed hospital in taiwan. taiwan currently has no strict regulatory policy regarding listeriosis in the food industry and no disease surveillance system. therefore , the incidence of and risk factors for human listeriosis in taiwan could not be determined precisely , and potential outbreaks might have been overlooked.
