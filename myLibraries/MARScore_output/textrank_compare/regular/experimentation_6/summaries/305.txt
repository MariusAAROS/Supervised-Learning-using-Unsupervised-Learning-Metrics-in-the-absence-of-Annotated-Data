patient and procedure related data , including demographics , characteristics , clinical information and technical details , and findings from ercp procedures were recorded prospectively on a detailed data sheet. ercp procedures were performed by a total of eight expert endoscopists , almost always with a trainee performing at least part of the procedure. other risk factors such as female gender , younger age , sphincter of oddi dysfunction , cannulation difficulty , prolonged procedure time , and repeated injection to the pancreatic duct were not assessed because ercp procedures were done by an expert and because of the absence of manometry. although some studies have evaluated the level of post ercp inflammatory markers , especially post procedure crp elevation , as predictors of development of pep,1923 it seems that none of the previous studies have focused on pre ercp esr level as a potential risk factor for pep. although it seems that our study is the first study to evaluate pre ercp esr level as a risk factor for developing pep , many other studies have evaluated the role of pharmacologic agents in reducing the incidence or severity of pep.2,10,2227 several agents , most of which have an anti inflammatory effect , have been tested in clinical trials. the present study examined prospectively the potential patient and procedure related risk factors , including esr , for pep in iranian population. precise identification of risk factors is of great importance for recognition of high risk cases in which ercp should be avoided if possible or protective modalities should be considered to minimize patients risk of morbidity and mortality.
