after further adjustment for diastolic blood pressure , fasting insulin and triglycerides , no prediction from low tpa activity on diabetes development was seen. low tpa activity and high pai1 activity is mainly explained by the presence of abdominal obesity but also by other metabolic disturbances characteristic of the insulin resistance syndrome , such as high serum levels of triglycerides and insulin. plasma levels of tpa antigen and pai1 activity were higher and tpa activity was lower. the risk of developing diabetes increased with increasing quartiles of tpa antigen and pai1 activity and decreased in a similar way for tpa activity ( figure 1 ). the number of cases in each quartile for tpa activity was 7 , 4 , 3 and 1. p values for x(linear by linear association ) were 0.026 for tpa activity , < 0,001 for tpa antigen and 0,007 for pai1 activity. quartiles 13 of tpa antigen and pai1 activity were contrasted with the fourth quartile and , for tpa activity , the first quartiles with quartile 24 ( table 2 ).
