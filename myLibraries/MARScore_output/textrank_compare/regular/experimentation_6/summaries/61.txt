our research firstly discovered that strem1 and pct had the equal prognostic ability for sepsis mortality and were superior to other parameters. combination of serum strem1 and pct levels and sofa score can offer the best powerful prognostic for sepsis mortality. the secretion of crp begins within 46 h after stimulus , doubles every 8 h thereafter , and peaks at 3650 h. the role of crp in sepsis prognostic value seemed different. we concluded that nt pro bnp may predict sepsis 28day mortality in different stages. firstly , our study chosen a part of sepsis biomarkers and did not put all biomarkers in the research. sepsis is the major cause of death in the intensive care unit. despite improvement of antibiotics treatment and supportive techniques , the mortality of septic shock increases to approximately 60%.
