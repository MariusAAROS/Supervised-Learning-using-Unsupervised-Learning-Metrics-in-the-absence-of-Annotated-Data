egfr gene amplification resulting in upwards of 12 copies per cell has been reported in hnscc patients compared to copy numbers detected in normal mucosa from noncancer patients. accordingly , significant effort has focused on egfr signaling as a therapeutic target for treating hnscc patients. gefitinib ( iressa ) is a small molecule tki targeted to the intracellular active site for phosphorylation that has been tested in clinical trials involving hnscc patients , as a single agent or in combination with radiation treatment. similarly , an exploratory study to assess the modulation of biomarkers in hnscc patients treated preoperatively with cetuximab and/or imc a12 , a humanized antiigf1r monoclonal antibody is currently underway ( http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ , identifier nct00617734 ). future clinical trials will be required to determine the suitability of amg102 and metmab as either single agents or combinatorial therapeutics for treating hnscc patients. encouraging data from this study , a randomized phase iii trial of xl184 in hnscc patients was initiated to investigate xl184 as a first line treatment ( compared with placebo ) for survival benefit to patients with hnscc ( http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ , identifier nct00704730 ). hnscc patients resistant to cetuximab , often succumb to local tumor recurrence as well as regional and distant metastasis.
