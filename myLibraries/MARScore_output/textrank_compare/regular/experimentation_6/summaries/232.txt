taking these unique actions of insulin degludec into consideration , switching from twice daily injections of basal insulin to once daily injection of insulin degludec. specifically , these studies investigated the effects of switching to insulin degludec in type 1 diabetes patients who were being treated with a combination of once or twice daily injections of insulin glargine or detemir , though there are no studies that focused on type 1 diabetes patients treated only with twice daily basal insulin. thus , the efficacy of basal insulin is especially important in this group of patients. importantly , in some type 1 diabetes patients with severe loss of endogenous insulin secretion capacity , once daily injection of basal insulin does not always cover the basal effect of insulin over the 24hour period [ 35 ]. then , the increase of the dose of basal insulin or titration of rapid acting insulin was performed by the judgement of each physician in charge. in addition to the longer duration of action of basal insulin , its effects on daily and day to day variability of plasma glucose should be noted. , our study demonstrated that glycemic control 12 weeks after switching to once daily insulin degludec injection with 20% dose reduction was comparable to that in patients treated with twice daily injection of basal insulin injections and that such switching did not change the frequency of nocturnal hypoglycemia recorded by cgm.
