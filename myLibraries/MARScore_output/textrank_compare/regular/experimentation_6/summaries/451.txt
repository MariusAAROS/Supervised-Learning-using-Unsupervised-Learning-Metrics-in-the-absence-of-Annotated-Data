in a study with 450 patients , seven cases of device embolization into pulmonary artery in the first 12 hours. conversely , deploying the device in patients with deficient cranial rims can be difficult and may lead to an unstable position of the device and increased risk of device embolization. the most common type of complications in percutaneous closure is device embolization , with a rate of 0.5% to 1 %. one hour after intervention we detected device embolization into the pulmonary artery after performing echocardiography since the patient had dyspnea. however , it should be kept in mind that improper patient and device selection may result in deadly complications like device embolization , cardiac perforation and tamponade. , snares can be used to take out the device , but most of the time , surgical extraction of the device and asd patch closure is needed. surgical or percutaneous closure in asymptomatic patients is indicated in the case of right ventricular volume overload and if the pulmonary to systemic flow ratio increases beyond 1.5.
