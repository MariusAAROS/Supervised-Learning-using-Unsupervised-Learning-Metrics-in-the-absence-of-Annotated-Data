the primary differences between psychostimulant induced dopamine release and release associated with normal learning about important environmental events such as rewards and stressors is : ( i ) since psychostimulants block the elimination of dopamine through dat , the level of dopamine achieved far exceeds what is possible from a biological stimulus ; ( ii ) in contrast to biological stimuli that cease to release dopamine once an approach or avoidance response to that stimulus has been learned , psychostimulants continue to release large amounts of dopamine upon every administration ( with the possible exception of extended binging that can temporarily deplete dopamine stores ). as outlined above , psychostimulant induced dopamine release is responsible for reinforcing behaviors designed to seek and administer the drugs. thus , when an organism encounters a novel stimulus , whether a positive stimulus such as a food reward or a negative stimulus such as a stressor , the activity of dopamine cells in the ventral tegmental area , and dopamine release in axon terminal fields in the prefrontal cortex , nucleus accumbens , and/or amygdale , are altered. thus , the neutral stimulus now causes dopamine release in a manner predicting arrival of a motivationally relevant event. based upon these data , the role for dopamine release in the mesocorticolimbic brain regions is twofold : ( i ) to cue the organism that a novel motivationally relevant event is occurring and that adaptive behavioral responses need to be engaged ( eg , approach a reward or avoid a stress ) ; ( ii ) once the behavioral response is established , dopamine release is antecedent to the appearance of the motivationally relevant event and is triggered by environmental associations that the organism has made with the event as part of learning the adaptive behavioral response. it is this overlearning of drugseeking behaviors by progressive associations formed between repeated drug induced dopamine release and the environment that is thought to lead to increased vulnerability to relapse. thus , the learning of a task to obtain the drug and the amount of drug taken in a given session is strongly regulated by dopamine release in the accumbens.
