thus , the aims of this study were to investigate whether metal interferes with the surface hardness and roughness of a visible light polymerized acrylic resin and to compare these values to those of water bath and microwave polymerized resins. 12 ( 2004 ) , who investigated the influence of denture cleansers on the surface roughness of heat and microwave polymerized resins. bath and microwave polymerized resins with respect to the hardness means at pre determined distances from a metal alloy. while denture base acrylic resins polymerized by microwave irradiation and conventional water bath curing systems are composed of pmma6,8 , visible light polymerized resins are similar to composites , having an organic instead of an inorganic filler content. visible light polymerized resins were initially proposed for clinical repairs and/or additions in sub extended removable dentures7 , but due to their easy manipulation and fast polymerization , their are now indicated for many clinical situations , such as transitional and interim dentures , complete and removable partial dentures , provisional splints , denture repairs and additions , orthodontic appliances and record bases5,7,9. however , further studies about the clinical behavior of visible light polymerized acrylic resins should be conducted. in addition , light polymerized resins can be processed directly in the mouth using a portable light curing device , which simplifies the clinical procedures9.
