the result was independently read by two microbiologists to minimize reading bias and interpreted as per the manufacturer 's recommendations : i)pct > 10 ng / ml : severe bacterial sepsis or septic shockii)pct 2 to 10 ng / ml : severe systemic inflammatory response , most likely due to sepsis unless other causes are knowniii)pct 0.5 to 2 ng / ml : a systemic infection can not be excludediv)pct < 0.5 ng / ml : local bacterial infection possible ; sepsis unlikely pct > 10 these include studies on its use in determining bacterial sepsis in children with febrile neutropenia , its use as a marker of renal parenchymal infection and its use as a marker of the severity of acute pancreatitis.[68 ] most studies using pct for interpretation of bacterial infection and sepsis have used the quantitative pct assay ( immunoluminometric method ). sensitivity and specificity of the pct assay were analyzed using two different cut off values for pct ( 0.5 ng / ml and 2 ng / ml ) ; sensitivity being pct positives / total no. of sepsis cases 100 and specificity being pct positives / total no. of cases without sepsis. sepsis can be difficult to distinguish from non infectious conditions in critically ill or comatose patients in the early stages ; and diagnosis , treatment and outcomes greatly differ between patients with and without sepsis. since early identification of infections and. sepsis is crucial for patient management , an effective marker specific for bacterial infection is very useful in the critical care settings. there are several markers of sepsis , like c reactive protein , serum procalcitonin ( pct ) , il6 , il8 , lactate , etc. , of. pct has been proposed as an indicator of the presence of infection and as a useful marker of the severity of sepsis.
