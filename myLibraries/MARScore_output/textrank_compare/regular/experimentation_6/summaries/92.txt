systemic treatment is recommended in clinical mastitis due to s. aureus and in severe cases of coliform mastitis , preferably in combination with imm treatment. one substance used for systemic treatment is penicillin g , which as a weak acid penetrates poorly into the mammary gland , however , due to the very low mic values of susceptible organisms , therapeutic concentrations can be achieved in milk. the efficacy of systemic treatment with penicillin g or penethamate has been shown in clinical trials. the only type of mastitis where systemic treatment would be clearly advantageous may be mastitis caused by s. aureus. finally , the antimicrobial used for systemic treatment of mastitis must be approved for dairy cattle. where to target antimicrobial therapy in clinical mastitis due to different pathogens the systemic route of administration has been suggested to be more efficient than imm for the treatment of clinical mastitis as antimicrobials theoretically have better penetration of the udder tissue by this route. macrolides would have ideal pharmacokinetics , but clinical studies have failed to demonstrate efficacy when used for the systemic treatment of clinical mastitis.
