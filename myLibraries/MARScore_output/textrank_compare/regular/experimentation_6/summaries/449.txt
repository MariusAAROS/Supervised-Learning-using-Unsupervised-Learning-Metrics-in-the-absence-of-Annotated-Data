we present our experience in the management of cases of syringomyelia due to dorsal spinal arachnoid bands and review the current available evidence of the diagnostic work up and management of this etiology. there was no history of previous trauma , central nervous system ( cns ) infection , or spinal surgery. there was no history of previous trauma , central nervous system ( cns ) infection , or spinal surgery. idiopathic arachnoid bands have been hypothesized to develop from the septum posticum , the membrane dividing the midline dorsal arachnoid space of the cervicothoracic spinal canal. mri scan [ figure 3 ] revealed a lower thoracic syrinx with some signal change in spinal cord. mri scan [ figure 3 ] revealed a lower thoracic syrinx with some signal change in spinal cord. syringomyelia is the development of a fluid filled cavity within the spinal cord.
