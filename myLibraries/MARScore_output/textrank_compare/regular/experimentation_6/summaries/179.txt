mpg expression was highest in grade iv and lowest in grade i ( figures 3(b ) and 3(c ) ) , indicating a close correlation of mpg protein expression with who grade. next , we analyzed the relationship between mpg expression and the glioma stage as well as the survival of patients. in addition , mpg expression was not significantly affected by the gender and age ( both p > 0.05 ) of the patients. the loss of mpg expression was a significant ( p < 0.001 ) and independent prognostic indicator for patients with glioma besides age , who grade and kps. kim et al. indicated that mpg expression in the brain was relative high in 1 week after birth , and the level remained low in day 400 mature adults , suggesting that brain tissue is terminally differentiated and nonproliferating tissues. furthermore , the most important finding of this study was the correlation of mpg expression and survival rates of patients. interestingly , mpg gene expression increased with the advancement of who grades from i to iv ( p < 0.001 ).
