extraction procedure and characterization of hydrocarbons hydrocarbons from workers , alates , soldiers , and fecal pellets of i. minor were extracted , characterized , and quantified as previously reported ( haverty et al. , 2005 ). the column oven was programmed from 200320c at 3c min , with a final hold of 11 min. electron impact ( ei ) mass spectra were obtained at 70 ev.all chemicals of interest were identified by their retention times and mass spectra. mass spectra of methyl branched alkanes were interpreted as described by blomquist et al. olefins were identified by their mass spectra , although double bond positions were not determined ( haverty et al. , 2005).in the text , tables , and figures , we use shorthand nomenclature to identify individual hydrocarbons or mixtures of hydrocarbons. the cuticular hydrocarbons for i. minor pseudergates and fecal pellets were characterized previously ( haverty et al. , 2000 , 2005 ). compounds are listed in elution orderacronyms for hydrocarbons are derived as follows : location of methyl groups ( x me ) , the total number of carbons ( cxx ) in the hydrocarbon component excluding the methyl branch(es ) , and the number of double bonds following a colon ( cxx : y)these hydrocarbons were not reported for i. minor pseudergates or fecal pellets in haverty et al. compounds are listed in elution order acronyms for hydrocarbons are derived as follows : location of methyl groups ( x me ) , the total number of carbons ( cxx ) in the hydrocarbon component excluding the methyl branch(es ) , and the number of double bonds following a colon ( cxx : y ) these hydrocarbons were not reported for i. minor pseudergates or fecal pellets in haverty et al. n alkanes and dimethylalkanes were the predominant classes of hydrocarbons in all castes and in fecal pellets ( table 2 ) , as previously reported by haverty et al. n alkanes comprised from 23.12% to 38.39% , unsaturated components from 15.21% to 19.03% , terminally branched monomethylalkanes from 3.90% to 5.32% , internally branched monomethylalkanes from 7.70% to 9.01% , and dimethylalkanes from 25.25% to 36.18% , of the total hydrocarbon content. there was also a homologous series of trimethylalkanes , representing 8.26% to 9.48% of the total hydrocarbon content.. table 2relative abundance of hydrocarbon classes from pseudergates , alates , soldiers , and fecal pellets of incisitermes minor ( hagen)hydrocarbon classpseudergatesalatessoldiersfecal pelletsnormal alkanes38.3923.1229.7718.71olefins18.3821.1120.3120.66terminally branched methylalkanes3.904.495.325.19internally branched methylalkanes9.017.708.888.33dimethylalkanes25.2436.1829.7937.40trimethylalkanes5.097.405.929.71percent of total hydrocarbon compositionall peaks with co eluting olefins and saturated compounds are summarized as olefinsthe hydrocarbons of i. minor characterized in this study included all of the compounds reported by haverty et al.
