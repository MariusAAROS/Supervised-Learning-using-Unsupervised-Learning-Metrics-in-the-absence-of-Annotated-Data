we report a case of predominantly external jugular vein ( ejv ) involvement in an adolescent male with negative blood culture results. mrv brain images demonstrate bilateral sagittal , straight , transverse and sigmoid sinuses with no evidence of thrombus extension. the role of anticoagulation however remains controversial with no conclusive literature evidence ; the decision should therefore be made on clinical grounds ; assessing severity of symptoms , poor treatment response and degree of thrombus extension. the patient remained in hospital on iv antibiotics for a total of 14 days , the noted swellings slowly decreased in size , blood results normalized and the trismus resolved. clinical findings can therefore vary considerably from neck pain and swelling associated with thrombophlebitis to pleuritic chest pain , haemoptysis , dyspnoea or arthralgia as a result of septic thromboemboli. postanginal septicaemia in the early 20 century ; originally associated with a mortality reaching 90% it involves a classic triad of oropahryngeal sepsis , internal jugular vein ( ijv ) thrombophlebitis and metastatic abscess formation ( 1 ).. a twelve year old boy presented to the children s assessment unit with a 24 hour history of unilateral face and neck swelling on a background of seven days progressive sore throat and dysphagia.
