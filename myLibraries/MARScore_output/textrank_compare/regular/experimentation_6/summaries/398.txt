a number of studies have looked at radiation exposure in critically ill patients undergoing repeated radiological procedures. however , the available literature on the extent of radiation exposure to icu personnel is scarce and relates mainly to the level of scattered radiation within the icu. the conclusion of these studies is that the level of radiation exposure is extremely low and does not pose a hazard to icu personnel. tlds can measure a wide dosimetric range ( from 10 gray to 10 grays ) of radiation exposure and are routinely used as personal dosimeters because they are small in size , convenient to use and not expensive. it is , therefore , natural that there may be concerns about the long term effects of radiation exposure to doctors working for long periods of time in the icu. in addition , where icu doctors are responsible for transport of patients to the radiology suite , the extent of radiation exposure is increased. it is reassuring that the results of our study confirm that the extent of radiation exposure to critical care physician during the course of his duty is well within acceptable limits.
