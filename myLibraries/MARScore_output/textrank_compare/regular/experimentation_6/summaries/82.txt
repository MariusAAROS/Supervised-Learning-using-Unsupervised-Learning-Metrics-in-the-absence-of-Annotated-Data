lman ra synaptic transmission is necessary for the variability of song in adult zebra finch , suggesting that the activity of nmda receptor on the lman ra synapses might induce the activity pattern change of ra neurons and change the bursts that control the vocal and respiratory muscles. nevertheless , pharmacological agents which block nmda receptors impair a variety of brain processes , suggesting that nmda receptor transmission also plays an important role beyond long term memory and participates in shaping the dynamic activity of neural networks. nmda receptors caused such membrane potential fluctuations between a hyperpolarized down state and a depolarized up state , which may gate the information and gain modulation. here , we test the gain change of ra projection neurons after exogenous nmda was applied to selectively activate nmda receptors , using whole cell current clamp recording in adult male zebra finch slices. then we used 50 m dl apv , a nmda receptor antagonist , to check the selectivity of nmda receptor , and we found that the slope of f i was not changed by dl apv alone ( p > 0.05 ). the effect of nmda on gain was mediated through nmda receptors and might involve synaptic activities. the pharmacology of nmda receptors involved in gain modulation has been examined in mammals.
