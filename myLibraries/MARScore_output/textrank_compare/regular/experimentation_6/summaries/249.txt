for est derived sequences without a database match , their frames and coding sequences are predicted based on the presence and the location of intrinsic signals in a sequence that include start codons , 5 or / and 3 stop codons and stretches of poly(a ) ( figure 1 ). for est derived sequences without a database match , their frames and coding sequences are predicted based on the presence and the location of intrinsic signals in a sequence that include start codons , 5 or / and 3 stop codons and stretches of poly(a ) ( figure 1 ). however , blastx using a nucleotide query against a protein database is able to reliably identify protein coding regions within a dna sequence if sufficient similarity exists between the translated query and an entry in the database ( 3 ). the other file contains the query identifiers for those sequences that do not have predicted protein coding regions ( figure 1j ). however , blastx using a nucleotide query against a protein database is able to reliably identify protein coding regions within a dna sequence if sufficient similarity exists between the translated query and an entry in the database ( 3 ). the other file contains the query identifiers for those sequences that do not have predicted protein coding regions ( figure 1j ). the 5utr may be truncated.a full length sequence as defined for category ( a ) , except that it does not contain any 5 stop codons.a partial sequence that has a portion of the 5utr , one or more 5 stop codons , the start codon and a portion of the coding region.a sequence that contains only 5utr sequence and there is a 5 stop codon.a sequence that contains a 5utr sequence , the start codon and a portion of the protein coding orf.a sequence that contains only 5utr sequence without a 5 stop codon.a sequence that contains a portion of the protein coding region , but does not contain the start codon or the stop codon.a sequence with the potential protein coding region truncated at its 5 end , one or more atg codons in the truncated orf , the stop codon and a 3utr.a sequence that contains a portion of the potential protein coding region and the 3utr sequence.a sequence that contains a portion of the 3utr and a poly(a ) sequence at its 3 end.
