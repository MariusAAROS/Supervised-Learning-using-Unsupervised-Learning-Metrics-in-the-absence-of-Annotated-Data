separate 10 mm stock solutions of nac and mpg were prepared by dissolving 163.2 mg ( 1 mmol ) of nac ( merck , darmstadt , germany ) or 163.2 mg ( 1 mmol ) of mpg ( sigma aldrich , st. louis , usa ) in deionised water up to 100.0 ml volume and stored in the dark bottle at 4c. a powder quantity equivalent to 100 mg of mpg was dissolved in 300 ml of deionised water , filtered through filter paper ( blue ribbon , s&s , germany ) , and the filtrate collected in a 500 ml volumetric flask was diluted by deionised water to the nominal volume. spectrophotometric methods have also been reported for the determination of nac and mpg in pharmaceutical formulations [ 1925 ].. a coupled redox complexation reaction has been reported for the spectrophotometric analysis of nac and mpg using 1,10phenanthroline as the chromogenic reagent. mpg is primarily used in the treatment of cystinuria , but studies have shown that mpg can be used as a chelating , cardioprotecting , and radioprotecting agent , as well as an antidote to heavy metal poisoning. a number of electrochemical [ 59 ] , fluorometric [ 1012 ] , chemiluminescence [ 1315 ] , and liquid chromatographic [ 1618 ] methods have been developed for the determination of nac and mpg in biological samples and pharmaceuticals. we report a simple and cost effective spectrophotometric method for the reliable analysis of nac and mpg in pharmaceutical formulations. the method is also based on the coupled redox complexation reaction between nac or mpg and fe(iii ) but uses 2,4,6tripyridyl s triazine ( tptz ) as the chromogenic reagent.
