this case report highlights the need for delayed imaging for even minor intimal flaps or small aortic injuries after trauma , since progression does occur. our patient had no other injuries , and there was no retroperitoneal hematoma or other signs of vascular injury in the area , as is usually seen on ct when the aorta is injured [ 35 ]. blunt traumatic infrarenal aortic injuries are rare , with a few case reports in the literature. only one study has compared conventional open repair with endovascular repair for blunt injuries of the abdominal aorta and found similar results in both groups. a more common occurrence is an intimal flap which may form after blunt injury to the aorta , and most of these will resolve with anticoagulation alone [ 1 , 2 ]. blunt aortic injury which initially presents as an intimal flap ( grade i ) may progress and evolve into an intramural hematoma ( grade ii ) or a pseudoaneurysm ( grade iii ). aortic intimal flap progressing to dissection or pseudoaneurysm is an occurrence identified in 2% or less of the patients , and the majority of these occur in the thoracic aorta [ 1 , 2 ].
