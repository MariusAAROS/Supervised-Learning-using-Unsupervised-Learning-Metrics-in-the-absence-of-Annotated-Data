although , we can not speculate on the mechanisms responsible for the different kinetics of decay of ammonia levels in the presence of down trending vpa levels we can confidently state that non elevated hepatic enzymes and hyperammonemia despite carnitine replacement indicated that hepatic damage and carnitine deficiency had very little role in causing the slowly down trending elevated ammonia levels in the presence of subtherapeutic serum vpa levels. vertical axes : straight line ( left ) : vpa levels ; dashed line ( right ) : venous ammonia levels. increasing vpa levels in serum was associated with increasing venous ammonia levels initially [ figure 1 ]. the serum ammonia normalized log linear plot in contrast showed two different decay kinetics : initial sharp down trend for vpa levels greater than 90.9 g / ml but much slower downtrend for vpa levels less than 90.9 g / ml down into the subtherapeutic range of 8.5 g / ml. patient continued to complain of lethargy for the next 4 days which subsequently alleviated. the peak concentration of ammonia noted was likely a decrement from the real peak based on the time to peak of depakote tablets being 4 h ( the patients initial vpa levels were measured at 2 h after she allegedly consumed the vpa while the next blood draw was 9 h later ). hyperammonemia and psychiatric disturbance secondary to valproate use in our case showed a score of 9 by a naranjo algorithm , indicating strong causality with the drug and placing it in causality category of definite.. our assessment of a high adverse reaction probability scale was based on the fact that there are previous conclusive reports of hyperammonemia secondary to vpa use with similar psychiatric features as presented in this case report , hyperammonemia occurred only after vpa use and eventually trended down to normal levels with discontinuation of vpa , patients psychiatric disturbance correlated with hyperammonemia , the patient symptomatically improved with drug discontinuation , there are no alternative explanation of hyperammonemia and altered mood in this case , the serum levels of vpa were elevated with concentrations known to be toxic and that toxic effects observed were more severe with high dose and less severe when secondary hyperammonemia decreased.
