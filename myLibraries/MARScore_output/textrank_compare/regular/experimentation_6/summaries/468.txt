the diagnoses of a localized fibrous tumor of the pleura , malignant mesothelioma , metastatic pleural malignancy , and rare primary pulmonary sarcoma ( e.g. , pleuropulmonary synovial sarcoma , fibrosarcoma , leimyosarcoma , sarcomatoid carcinoma , malignant nerve sheath tumor , hemangiopericytoma , and malignant fibrous histiocytoma ) were considered. although mri is the most accurate technique for demonstrating cardiac mass , oncologists found the following mri might be ineffective for choosing further treatment for the pericardial mass due to high cost. therefore , they agreed to operate surgical resection to treat pericardial mass without obtaining cardiac mri. associated lymphadenopathy as well as calcifications , cortical bone destruction , or tumor infiltration of the chest wall and musculature are infrequent. primary pleuropulmonary synovial sarcoma ( ppss ) is a rare soft tissue malignancy representing only 0.1% 0.5% of all primary lung malignancies. the frequency of cardiac metastasis from soft tissue sarcomas ranges from 3.5% to 35% with only two cases of metastatic synovial sarcoma of the heart reported : one involving the right ventricle and the other the left ventricle. both cases had a primary tumor in the extremities rather than in the lungs without focusing on the imaging findings of these rare lesions ( 2 4 ).
