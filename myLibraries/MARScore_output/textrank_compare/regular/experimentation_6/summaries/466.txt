fraction of inspired sevoflurane at different time interval ( pi post intubation , fi fraction of inspired ) end tidal sevoflurane at different time intervals ( pi post intubation ) during anesthesia maintenance , group b showed a statistical significant decrease in heart rate , systolic and diastolic blood pressure from baseline at all time points as compared to the group a ( p < 0.05 ). the consenting patients were randomly allocated into one of the two anesthetic groups based on the simple randomization table generated : group a ( control group ) : sevoflurane fentanyl and group b ( test group ) : sevoflurane dexmedetomidine. the patients in group b received dexmedetomidine(2 ml diluted in 48 ml of saline ) iv in a dose of 1 mcg / kg over10 minutes through infusion pump prior to induction. the fisevo concentration was significantly less in group b as compared to the group a at all time points ( p < 0.05 ) a significant decrease of 13% to 33% of etsevo concentration was seen with group b from 5 min to 60 minutes post intubation ( p < 0.05 ) during surgery [ figure 2 ]. an average 6.5% fall in heart rate from baseline in group b as compared to 3.7% rise in the group a , 8% fall in systolic blood pressure from baseline as compared to 3.6% rise in the group a , and 8.16% fall in diastolic blood pressure from baseline as compared to 3.3% rise in the group a was observed [ figures 3 and 4 ]. bradycardia was observed in 2 patients in group b within 10 mins post extubation , which promptly responded to atropine 0.6 mg iv.
