these situations are indicative of locoregional disease treatment using complex and expensive techniques such as hadrontherapy.. local relapse or local recurrence ( these two terms are synonymous ) : it means the redevelopment , at the same site as initially , of a previously effectively treated tumour ( dictionary of medical terms , garnier delamare ).. these situations are indicative of locoregional disease treatment using complex and expensive techniques such as hadrontherapy.. local relapse or local recurrence ( these two terms are synonymous ) : it means the redevelopment , at the same site as initially , of a previously effectively treated tumour ( dictionary of medical terms , garnier delamare ).. french cancer registries record data required to estimate cancer incidence but fail to provide sufficient detail of the tumour stage or of therapeutic data. in all likelihood , cases eligible for hadrontherapy could have been treated by these private centres during the study and ignored.. one should be very cautious when comparing the results of this study with those of published incidence studies. nonthreatening m+ dissemination or controlled by medical treatments : this means the presence of one or more remote metastases at the time of diagnosis , presenting no immediate threat as displaying slow development and/or accessible to effective treatment ( typical case of some low grade sarcomas lung metastases ). nonthreatening m+ dissemination or controlled by medical treatments : this means the presence of one or more remote metastases at the time of diagnosis , presenting no immediate threat as displaying slow development and/or accessible to effective treatment ( typical case of some low grade sarcomas lung metastases ). hadrontherapy is an innovative form of radiotherapy , based on high technology equipment using proton or carbon ions beams to destroy tumours [ 1 , 2 ].
