in most cases of stent migration endoscopic retrieval. 15% of stents will become accidentally dislocated , but efforts to develop technically superior stents continue. describe a stent in stent combination which employs the mechanical advantages of both plastic stents and fully covered self expandable metal stents. when possible an endoscopic approach should generally be attempted in all patients with pseudocysts , and for pancreatic fluid collections endoscopic transmural drainage is the treatment of choice. endoscopic methods are among the most important and frequently employed means of treating pancreatic pseudocysts. if the cyst contains more than 2/3 solid material a self expandable stent should be selected to ensure effective drainage. an additional advantage of the self expandable metal stent is that the necrotic tissue contained within the cyst can be actively removed using an endoscope.
