, cbd was also explored to search for other possible source of obstructive jaundice such as cbd stone since primary biliary stone is known to occur more frequently in the presence of pad ( 9 , 10 ). these findings were confirmed on endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ercp ) which showed normal biliary orifice ( fig. 2a ) with impacted dark brown pigment stone ( henceforth enterolith ) at the pad orifice ( fig. follow up ercp was performed again after 6 months but there was no recurrence of cbd stone or enterolith. periampullary diverticula ( pad ) refer to extraluminal outpouchings of duodenal mucosa that develop within the radius of 2 to 3 cm from the ampulla of vater ( 1 ). pad are largely asymptomatic but they sometimes can cause both pancreaticobiliary and non pancreaticobiliary complications. rarely , obstructive jaundice can develop secondary to pad in the absence of choledocholithiasis or tumor and is termed lemmel 's syndrome ( 2 ). among duodenal diverticula. , pad is the most common type comprising about 70% to 75% of all duodenal diverticula ( 1 ).
