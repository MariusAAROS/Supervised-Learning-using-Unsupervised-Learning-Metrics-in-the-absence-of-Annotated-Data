it may be concluded : 1. gold should be the material of choice for abutment fixation screws , since it produced the highest preload values , followed by surface treated titanium screws and conventional titanium screws ; 2. titanium screws presented the highest torque removal values , followed by gold screws , and surface treated titanium screws. group a was formed by gold screws , group b was formed by titanium screws , and group c was formed by surface treated titanium screws. the findings of the present study suggest a trend for greater preload values verified for gold screws , followed by surface treated titanium screws and titanium screws , confirming the outcomes of previous investigations4,8. titanium screws presented a mean removal torque of 18.751.89 ncm , and showed statistically significant differences ( p<0.001 ). a maximum preload value of 666.4 n for gold screws and 458.2 n for titanium screws was reported8. in addition , the finds of the present study suggest that the evaluated surface treatment of titanium screws was effective , since these screws presented higher preload values than conventional titanium screws. this was performed to eliminate a possible bias caused by elastic deformation that might occur in titanium screws during fixation , which might not only quantitatively but qualitatively influence the study outcomes and impair comparison among groups.
