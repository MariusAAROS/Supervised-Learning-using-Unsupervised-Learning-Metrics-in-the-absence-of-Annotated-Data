preoperative gfr was 71 28 ml / min for opn patients , 76 25 ml / min for lpn patients , and 96 37 ml / min for rpn patients ( p = 0.004 ). discharge hematocrit was significantly lower for opn patients ( 30 3% ) compared to lpn ( 36 4% ) and rpn ( 35 4% ) patients ( p < 0.0001 ). robotic partial nephrectomy ( rpn ) and lpn have also been compared with similar outcomes , if not superior rpn outcomes , in the hands of an experienced minimally invasive surgeon. there was no difference in intraoperative complication rate , tumor pathology , or margin status between the opn , ldn , and rpn patients ( table 2 ). there was a statistical trend towards lower preoperative hematocrit for opn patients compared to the minimally invasive patients ( opn40 4% , lpn43 4% , rpn42 4% , p = 0.09 ). thus , we report the perioperative outcomes of 106 consecutive patients treated with partial nephrectomy by a single surgeon using all three surgical approaches opn , lpn , and rpn. from august 2006 to february 2012 , a single surgeon ( rm ) with minimally invasive and urologic oncology fellowship training performed 106 consecutive partial nephrectomies using any of the three available surgical modalities opn , lpn , or rpn.
