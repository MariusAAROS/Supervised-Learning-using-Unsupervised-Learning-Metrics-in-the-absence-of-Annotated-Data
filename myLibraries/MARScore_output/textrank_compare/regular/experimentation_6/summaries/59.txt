a thorough literature review was done searching for high creatine kinase levels in patients with acute rhabdomyolysis. the risk factors that predispose a patient with rhabdomyolysis for developing acute renal injury are creatine kinase level concentration more than 5000 u / l , creatine kinase value upon admission , and slower decline in the serum creatine kinase level. the laboratory tests showed elevated creatine kinase level ( 1 778 856 u / l ; normal range 20 200. the breakdown releases the normal cell contents into the bloodstream , including creatine kinase , myoglobin , phosphorus , and potassium. on the other hand , a recent study by fernandez et al showed that the most reliable predictor of acute renal failure and the need for dialysis is the creatinine level above 1.7 , despite the peak creatine kinase. a research article in 2013 examined the clinical spectrum of patients with rhabdomyolysis presenting to the pediatric emergency department , in which the peak serum level of creatine kinase was 9825.1 23 079.1. the only risk factor for developing acute renal injury that our patient had was a high peak creatine kinase level upon admission.
