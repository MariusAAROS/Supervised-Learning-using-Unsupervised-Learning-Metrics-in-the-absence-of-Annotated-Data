peptide substrates were first used to screen reaction conditions and identify the site of modification. the most common methods for protein modification target the nucleophilic side chains of lysine and cysteine. this could result from dimerization of the oxidized species before protein coupling , but has yet to be characterized due to the low abundance of this product. myoglobin and a mutant of the tobacco mosaic virus ( tmv ) coat protein were used as native protein substrates. the synthetic modification of proteins enables the construction of biomolecular hybrids that can be used to study protein function , deliver potent therapeutics to cellular targets , and build new materials. the synthesis of these constructs requires a suite of chemoselective bioconjugation reactions that proceed under mild , aqueous conditions in the presence of the native functional groups that are present on protein surfaces. however , these strategies can result in complex product mixtures , as lysine is typically found in high abundance on the protein surface and uniquely reactive cysteine labeling sites can be difficult to install in many instances ( such as thiol proteases and proteins produced via the eukaryotic secretory pathway , for example ).
