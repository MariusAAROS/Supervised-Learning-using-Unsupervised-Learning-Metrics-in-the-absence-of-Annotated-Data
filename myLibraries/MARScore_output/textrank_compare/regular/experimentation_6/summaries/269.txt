from supporting information figure s4a ,. this shows that dissociation of fluorine for c3 in mefdc occurs at lower energy than dissociation of fluorine for c3 in gemcitabine ( supporting information figure s4 ). a second minimum structure was also found in the electronic energy profile in which the h3o stabilizes the fatom through forming a hydrogen bond of identical length , 1.57 ( see supporting information figure s4d ). therefore , the mechanism of c3 formation due to one electron oxidation of gemcitabine is proposed as follows : one electron oxidation of gemcitabine results in the formation of metastable c , which is unstable even at ca.. to explore the reaction mechanism of c2 formation from c3 in one electron oxidized mefdc and gemcitabine , using the dft b97x/6 31g(d ) method. c2 formation does not occur in gemcitabine but does in its analog mefdc. the electronic energy profile of f dissociation from c2 site of c3 in mefdc as well as the electronic energy profile of f dissociation for each of the two f atoms from c2 site of c3 in gemcitabine were obtained in the presence of a single water molecule at the same level of theory ( supporting information figure s4c , d ).
