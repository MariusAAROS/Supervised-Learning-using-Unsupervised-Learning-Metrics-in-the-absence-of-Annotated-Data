treatment of niphs involves lifelong dietary modification consisting of frequent , low carbohydrate meals ( 5 ) , which prevent surges in plasma glucose level , insulin level , and the consequent hypoglycemic spells. treatment of niphs involves lifelong dietary modification consisting of frequent , low carbohydrate meals ( 5 ) , which prevent surges in plasma glucose level , insulin level , and the consequent hypoglycemic spells. affected patients can present in adulthood ; de novo mutations should be considered given the following: positive family history of unremitting hypoglycemia lifelong symptoms of low plasma glucose , even after eating increased bmi negative sulfonylurea and autoimmune work up positive glycemic response to octreotide positive family history of unremitting hypoglycemia lifelong symptoms of low plasma glucose , even after eating negative sulfonylurea and autoimmune work up positive glycemic response to octreotide to our knowledge , only three families with affected adults have been reported. affected patients can present in adulthood ; de novo mutations should be considered given the following: positive family history of unremitting hypoglycemia lifelong symptoms of low plasma glucose , even after eating increased bmi negative sulfonylurea and autoimmune work up positive glycemic response to octreotide positive family history of unremitting hypoglycemia lifelong symptoms of low plasma glucose , even after eating negative sulfonylurea and autoimmune work up positive glycemic response to octreotide to our knowledge , only three families with affected adults have been reported. on arrival to the emergency department , plasma glucose was 20 mg / dl. plasma insulin , proinsulin , c peptide , and beta hydroxybutyrate levels should be assessed to exclude surreptitious use of insulin or insulin receptor antibodies. a 48h supervised fast should be done to exclude insulinoma , with plasma insulin and proinsulin levels.
