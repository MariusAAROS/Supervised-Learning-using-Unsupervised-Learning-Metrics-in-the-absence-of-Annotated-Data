, we describe a case a young female with ss who presented with features of gitelman syndrome and hypokalemic paralysis. hypokalemic alkalosis , high urinary chloride , hypomagnesemia , absence of hypercalciuria in background of no history of diuretic use favored the diagnosis of gitelman syndrome. proximal tubular abnormalities are less frequent , and rarely fanconi 's syndrome has been reported in patients with ss. acquired gitelman syndrome is relatively rare. acquired gitelman syndrome secondary to ss presenting with hypokalemic weakness is very rare. though gitelman syndrome is an inherited disorder ,. acquired gitelman syndrome should be considered in differential diagnosis of renal involvement in patients with ss. to the best of our knowledge , only five cases of acquired gitelman syndrome have been reported in english literature so far.
