scarce.12,15 moreover , there is only one investigation about quality of root fillings and coronal restorations in turkish population.16 the aim of the present study was to relate the quality of root canal treatment and coronal restorations to the periapical status of root filled teeth in adult turkish population based on radiographic examination. the total number of root filled teeth was 890 ( 9.39% ) ; of which 658 ( 73.9% ) teeth had ap. apical periodontitis was found in 75.5% of teeth with adequate length of root filling , whereas if the filling was too short or long , periapical lesions were present in 72.8% and 96.2% of teeth , respectively. in contrast , sunay et al12 reported 90.8% of root filled teeth with apical periodontitis had inadequate root canal fillings , the majority of them being short of the radiographic apex. root filled teeth without voids had ap in 72.9% of cases , whereas if voids were detected , ap was present in 74.7% of the teeth ( p : 0.54 , odds ratio : 1.09 , ci : 0.811.48 ). in addition , extraction of teeth due to low socio economic status gives rise to a limited number of root filled teeth epidemiologically. dugas et al4 reported the prevalence of apical periodontitis close to 60% when the root filling was inadequate , regardless of whether the filling was too short or too long consistent with the observations in other studies.17,19,27 in the present study , the relationship between the type of coronal restoration within root filled teeth and the presence of apical periodontitis were investigated. if radiographs reveal that a lesion has remained the same or has only diminished in size , the treatment is not considered a success.1,2 it is generally accepted that the outcome of endodontic treatment is positively correlated with the technical quality of the root filling , expected to provide an hermetic seal against bacterial ingress.3,4 however , it has been suggested that the quality of the coronal restoration may also have an impact on the periapical health of root filled teeth;5,6 when the restoration quality is good , this may allow for a favorable outcome even when the root filling quality is poor.7 attention has been focused on the prevalence and the technical quality of root fillings through the evaluation of intraoral810 or panoramic radiographs.2,11,12 epidemiologic studies have been performed on the root canal morphology in turkish populations.13,14 information about the prevalence and technical standard of root canal treatment , and the occurence of periapical lesions in turkey are
