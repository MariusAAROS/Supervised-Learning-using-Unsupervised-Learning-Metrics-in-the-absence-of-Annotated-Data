given this infrequent but known complication of balloon type cystostomy catheters , it is not surprising that a similar complication occurred in our patient. a retained urethral catheter due to balloon malfunction is a well recognized urologic complication. flexible nephroscopy was performed to evaluate for balloon fragments , which were not identified , and to remove the lower pole stone. contrast was then instilled through the chiba needle to evaluate the integrity of the balloon and exclude the possibility of retained balloon fragments from a ruptured balloon ( figure 2b ). percutaneous nephrolithotomy ( pcnl ) is a widely accepted treatment for urinary calculi > 2 cm or resistant to other modalities. complications of this procedure are well reported ; however , to our knowledge no mention has occurred in the literature of a retained nephrostomy tube after pcnl. thus , we will present the management of a retained council tip catheter after pcnl.
