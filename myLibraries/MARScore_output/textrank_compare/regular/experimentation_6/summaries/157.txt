epidemiologic investigation of an outbreak of s. typhimurium dt160 infection in new from may to august 2001 found that contact with dead wild birds , contact with other persons with gastrointestinal illness , and consumption of fast food were all significantly associated with illness. strategies for addressing these exposures include routine treatment of roof collected rainwater , hygienic disposal of dead birds , and promotion of hand hygiene protocols and sick foodhandler policies in fast food outlets. direct handling of dead wild birds , consumption of fast food , and consumption of food at a large gathering , such as at a party or large barbecue , were also significantly associated with illness. after stepwise regression , contact with a person with gastrointestinal illness in the 28 days before onset of illness in the case patient ( adjusted odds ratio [ or ] 2.8 ; 95% confidence interval [ ci ] 1.4 to 5.4 ) , exposure to dead wild birds ( adjusted or 10.5 ; 95% ci 2.3 to 47.5 ) , and consumption of fast food ( adjusted or 1.7 ; 95% ci 1.0 to 2.9 ) had independent significant associations with illness. consumption of fast food was associated with illness ; however , no single type of food outlet or food was identified. consumption of fast food may have occurred in environments contaminated by bird feces , or the foods themselves may have been contaminated , either during production or by infected foodhandlers ( 15 ). we defined a case as diarrhea ( 3 loose stools in a 24hour period ) or vomiting after april 28 , 2001 , with a stool specimen positive for s. typhimurium dt160.
