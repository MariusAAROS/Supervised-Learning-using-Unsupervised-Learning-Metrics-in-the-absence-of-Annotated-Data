means and standard deviations ( sd ) for loading forces at 0.1 mm intervals of deflection for wire samples in groups i iii means and standard deviations ( sd ) for unloading forces at 0.1 mm intervals of defl ection for wire specimens in groups i iii load deflection graph of beta wires in the control group and after sterilization with dry and moist heat load deflection graph of cna wires in the control group and after sterilization with dry and moist heat load deflection graph of res wires in the control group and after sterilization with dry and moist heat load deflection graph of hone wires in the control group and after sterilization with dry and moist heat load deflection graph of tmal wires in the control group and after sterilization with dry and moist heat repeated measures anova showed that during loading , hone wire had the least force level ( p < 0.05 ) and res wire had the highest force level. during unloading , tmal and hone wires exhibited the lowest force levels ( p < 0.05 ) ; although the force of tmal wire was a little less than that of hone wire. during unloading , tmal and hone wires exhibited the lowest force levels ( p < 0.05 ) ; although the force of tmal wire was a little less than that of hone wire. the force levels of res and cna wires were significantly higher than that of tmal wire ( p < 0.05 ). the force levels of res and cna wires were significantly higher than that of tmal wire ( p < 0.05 ). however , sterilization with dry heat did not result in significant changes in force levels during loading and unloading of tmal wires [ figure 6 ]. the results of the present study with tmal wires are consistent with the results of a study by smith et al. with tma wires.
