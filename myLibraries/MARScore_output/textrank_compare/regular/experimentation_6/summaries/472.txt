given that the prevalence of hypertension in asia is increasing , and that diabetes and hypertension commonly coexist ( type 2 diabetes patients are twice as likely to have elevated blood pressure than nontype 2 diabetes patients ) , screening these highrisk patients for ckd early might help slow the course of renal function decline and reduce the greater cardiovascular mortality risk observed in such individuals47. given that the prevalence of hypertension in asia is increasing , and that diabetes and hypertension commonly coexist ( type 2 diabetes patients are twice as likely to have elevated blood pressure than nontype 2 diabetes patients ) , screening these highrisk patients for ckd early might help slow the course of renal function decline and reduce the greater cardiovascular mortality risk observed in such individuals47. for instance , the uk prospective diabetes study compared the effects of intensive bloodglucose control with either sulfonylureas or insulin and conventional treatment ( including diet ) on the risk of microvascular and macrovascular complications in type 2 diabetes patients. indeed , the benefits of early and tight target control strategies on the prevention of dn in chinese type 2 diabetes patients have been observed. for instance , the uk prospective diabetes study compared the effects of intensive bloodglucose control with either sulfonylureas or insulin and conventional treatment ( including diet ) on the risk of microvascular and macrovascular complications in type 2 diabetes patients. indeed , the benefits of early and tight target control strategies on the prevention of dn in chinese type 2 diabetes patients have been observed. however , secondgeneration sulfonylureas , such as gliclazide and glipizide , which have inactive metabolites , carry less risk of hypoglycemia than the firstgeneration sulfonylureas and might therefore be used in type 2 diabetes patients with declining renal function , but with caution.
