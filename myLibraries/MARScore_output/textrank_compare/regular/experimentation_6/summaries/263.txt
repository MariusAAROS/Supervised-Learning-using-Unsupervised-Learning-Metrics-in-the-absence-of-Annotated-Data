we remove appf tissue in low risk patients because removal of this tissue leads to better exposure of the prostatic apex , puboprostatic ligaments , endopelvic fascia and junction of bladder and prostate. no ln was detected in appf tissue in patients with pt0 ( n = 1 ) and pt3b ( n = 8) disease. no ln was detected in appf tissue in patients with postoperative gs of 5 + 3 = 8 ( n = 1 ) , 3 + 5 = 8 ( n = 2 ) and 4 + 5 = 9 ( n = 6 ). we summarized the outcomes of published literature on appf tissue and presence of lns in table 2.. outcomes of published literature on periprostatic fat tissue and presence of lymph nodes the european association of urology ( eau ) and national comprehensive cancer network ( nccn ) recommended extended pelvic lymph node dissection ( plnd ) in patients at 10% or greater and 7% or greater calculated risk , respectively , for ln metastases. in addition , we always remove appf tissue and send it separately for histopathologic evaluation in patients with low , intermediate and high risk in order to identify the presence of lns and possible metastasis that we think could have an impact on identifying the correct stage of the disease. if a metastatic ln is detected in appf tissue ; patients might require adjuvant hormone therapy or radiotherapy. in addition , because we think that complete removal of appf tissue leads to better exposure of the surgical field to the operating console surgeon , we excise it even in patients with low risk pca.
