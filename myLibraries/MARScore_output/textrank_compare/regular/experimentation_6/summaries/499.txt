decoration of complex 2 at the bdt ligand with two carboxylates results in complex 1 which can be introduced into mofs by pse of 1,4benzenedicarboxylate ( bdc ) ligands , which is a common ligand linker in many mofs ( figure 1 ). have been incorporated in mofs and were shown to drive photochemical hydrogen production catalyzed by pt nanoparticles. metal organic frameworks ( mofs ) , also referred to as porous coordination polymers , have emerged as an intriguing class of microporous crystalline materials due to their intrinsic topology and porosity and have been studied for a range of applications in gas storage / separation , chemical sensing , drug delivery , and catalysis. unlike other porous materials such as zeolites , the organic ligand component of mofs allows for functionalization of internal channels and/or cavities either through direct solvothermal synthesis or by postsynthetic modification reactions that include the metathesis of metal ions and organic linkers under relatively mild conditions. incorporation of catalytic sites into mofs has resulted in heterogeneous catalysts that promote a wide range of organic reactions. platinum and other noble metals can serve as heterogeneous hydrogen evolution catalysts ; however , their limited earth abundance and cost precludes further development and/or large scale applications. the direct conversion of solar energy to a chemical fuel is an essential part of future sustainable energy systems that are independent of fossil reserves.
