the aim of this study was to demonstrate whether there is any difference between two group of patients with coronary atherosclerotic plaque and subjects without coronary atherosclerosis for the presence of c. pneumoniae dna by polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) method. pcr was performed for detecting c. pneumoniae dna by using the pcr kits ( dna technology ( jsc ) , pcr kit , moscow , russia ). bahrmand et al.25 and ericson et al.34 examined the relationship of c. pneumoniae infection to the severity of coronary atherosclerosis by pcr and serology respectively. they examined coronary artery samples with two different methods , and both revealed a high rate of reactivity to this bacterium in severe atherosclerosis and a much lower rate in mild atherosclerosis ; therefore , they concluded that severity ( stage ) of atherosclerosis can be presumed as an important factor in diagnosis of c. pneumoniae infection. in conclusion , we did not find any significant association between c. pneumoniae infection and coronary artery atherosclerosis by pcr method. c pneumonia infection can be diagnosed by various methods such as serology with an increase in serum antibodies against the organism , dna detectionby pcr , immunocytochemistry , electron microscopyand c. pneumonia isolation by culture.14 in other studies , the most widely used method for identifying of c. pneumoniae infection was based on antibody detection. et al.,15 jantos et al.27 and satpathy et al.28 similarly , reszka et al.,29 studied presence of c. pneumonia dna in aortic vessels , voorend et al.30 in cerebral vessels , and kwon et al.31 in carotid arteries and could not establish any significant difference in pcr results between the study and control groups.
