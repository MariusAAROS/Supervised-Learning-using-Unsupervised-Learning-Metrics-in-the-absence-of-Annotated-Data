it is hypothesized that mitochondrial abnormalities impair the ability of brain tumors to generate energy from ketone bodies. the same genomic defects that are involved in the creation of brain tumors can be exploited for their destruction [ 3 , 10 , 11 ]. surprisingly , despite the appealing efficacy of this treatment , no further human studies or clinical trials on the kd as a therapy for brain tumors have been conducted. several laboratory studies in mouse and rat models have recently confirmed that inhibition of brain tumor growth is directly related with reduced levels of glucose and elevated levels of ketone bodies. one of the most intriguing and active fields of research is the effect of a high fat caloric restricted diet on the survival of brain tumors cells. neuroprotection can contribute to the anticonvulsant effect , but it may have other effects as well , which can lead to other clinical uses of the kd. the value of the ketogenic diet ( kd ) has been recognized in the treatment of epilepsy , although the exact mechanisms by which it exerts its effect remain an enigma.
