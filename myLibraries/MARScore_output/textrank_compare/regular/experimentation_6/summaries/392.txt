spore counts were not related to the type of land use : in allotment garden soil , counts were not significantly different from soil samples taken from a pasture ( p = 0.423 ; t test ). soil samples were thawed and 50 mg were suspended in 0.9 ml sodium acetate buffer and 0.1 ml aluminium chloride ( alcl3 , 0.5 m ). the identical dpa extraction protocol was applied for soil samples. microwave treatment of spore suspensions and soil samples led to a fast release of dpa ( figure 1 ). in summary , microwave treatment of soil samples followed by the measurement of fluorescence after addition of terbium proved to be a fast and easy method to assess the content of bacterial spores. lyophilized aliquots of approximately 1 g were transferred to an eppendorf micro test tube ( 2 ml ) and ground ( by adding a 6 mm glass bead ) in tissuelyser ( retsch , haan , germany ) for 5 1 min. elemental composition ( carbon , hydrogen , nitrogen ) of soil was performed with a chn932 elemental analyzer ( leco corp. , st. composition ( in % of dry soil ) varied between 2.2 and 15.4 , 0.2 and 1.4 , and 0.2 and 2.0 for total carbon , total hydrogen , and total nitrogen , respectively. a transect ( approximately 100 m in length ) through a grass field with different land use management ( unused meadow , allotment garden , and pasture ) gave spore numbers in the range of 5 to 9 10 spores per gram of dry soil ( figure 3 ).
