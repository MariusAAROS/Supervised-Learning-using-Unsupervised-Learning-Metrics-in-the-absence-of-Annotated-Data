this study aimed to determine the primary clinical presentation that most frequently leads to the discovery of adrenal enlargement , to evaluate clinical characteristics and functional status of these patients , and to analyze risk factors for functional lesions. this retrospective study included 578 patients with adrenal imaging features showing adrenal enlargement who were hospitalized at the department of endocrinology in pla general hospital ( beijing , china ) between january 1993 and july 2013. patients with diseases known to cause adrenal enlargement , such as known endocrine disorders which could affect adrenal size , trauma , and underlying malignancy , were excluded. of 578 patients with adrenal enlargement , 78 cases ( 13.49% ) were detected incidentally. as shown in table 1 , routine medical checkup was found to have the greatest chance ( 43.59% ) of revealing clinical onsets leading to the discovery of adrenal enlargement. in addition , smooth enlargement was more common , in 53 ( 83% ) cases , and together these statistics reflect the likelihood that adrenal enlargement will be bilateral , smooth , and found in men. in the relevant literature [ 48 ] , adrenal enlargement can result from endocrine disorders , such as adrenocorticotropic hormone ( acth ) dependent or independent cushing syndrome , pa , multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 ( men1 ) , and congenital adrenal hyperplasia.
