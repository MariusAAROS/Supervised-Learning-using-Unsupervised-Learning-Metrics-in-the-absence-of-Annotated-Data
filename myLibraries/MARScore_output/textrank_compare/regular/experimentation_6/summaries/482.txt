the sperm fertilizing the oocyte ( leading sperm ) is indicated by a blue circle , while the sperm following the fertilizing sperm ( following sperm ) is indicated by a red circle among three oocytes ( a ). the sperm fertilizing the oocyte ( leading sperm ) is indicated by a blue circle , while the sperm following the fertilizing sperm ( following sperm ) is indicated by a red circle among three oocytes ( a ). however , once the leading sperm reached the oocyte membrane across the perivitelline space , the following sperm immediately ceased further penetration , within 10 s. the behaviors of the leading and following sperm were identical among the three oocytes.fig. the behaviors of the leading and following sperm were identical among the three oocytes imaged and analyzed. two types of mechanisms for polyspermy block have been reported : the oocyte membrane block to sperm penetration and the zona reaction. we believe that a novel mechanism of polyspermy block takes place in the zp , which differs from both the oocyte membrane block to sperm penetration ( fast block to polyspermy ) and the zona reaction ( slow block to polyspermy ) the findings of our tlc analysis indicate the existence of a novel mechanism of polyspermy block , which takes place in the zona pellucida and differs from the oocyte membrane block to sperm penetration ( fast block to polyspermy ) and the zona reaction ( slow block to polyspermy ) a proposed mechanism for a fast zona block to polyspermy during the human fertilization process.
