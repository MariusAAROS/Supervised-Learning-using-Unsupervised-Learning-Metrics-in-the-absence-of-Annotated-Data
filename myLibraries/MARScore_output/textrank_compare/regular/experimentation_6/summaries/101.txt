soft tissue growths with sessile bases on right buccal mucosa soft tissue growths with sessile bases on the tongue laboratory findings revealed a raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( esr ) ( 70 mm in the first hour ) , a decreased hemoglobin level ( 7.5 gm% ) , and the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ( elisa ) was found to be nonreactive. a panoramic radiograph disclosed asymmetric enlargement of the right side of the mandible , with loss of cortication of the lower border in the midline area , expansion of the body of the mandible causing displacement of the teeth , seen on right side , expansion of the right inferior alveolar nerve canal , enlarged mental foramen , resorption of the roots of the mandibular right teeth , and loss of the right antegonial notch. the commonly affected sites for sn are the thorax and abdomen ( 55% ) , upper extremities ( 20% ) , and lower limb and face ( 10% each ). neurofibromatosis ( nf ) is an autosomal dominant disease , discovered in 1882 , by the german pathologist friedrich daniel von recklinghausen , characterized by disordered growth of ectodermal tissues , and is part of a group of disorders called phakomatoses ( neurocutaneous syndrome ). neurofibromatosis type i ( nf1 ) , also known as von recklinghausen syndrome , is caused by the mutation of a gene on the long arm of chromosome 17 , which encodes a protein known as neurofibromin. it is characterized by spots of increased skin pigmentation ( caf au lait spots ) , combined with peripheral nerve tumors and a variety of other dysplastic abnormalities of the skin , nervous system , bones , endocrine organs , and blood vessels. the localized form of neurofibromatosis type i , first described by gammel in 1931 , is very rare.
