sound enamel was not statistically significant from hypocalcified enamel , carious enamel was not statistically significant from stained enamel , and lastly stained enamel was not statistically significant from hypocalcified enamel. the oct image of stained enamel in figure 4(d ) demonstrates increased light backscattering when compared to sound enamel , but again there is no triangular shaped subsurface light back scattering as observed with wsls.. average raman depolarization ratios ( ) from the various groups are depicted in a box and whisker plot ( figure 5 ). although areas of stain are not easily distinguishable from hypocalcified enamel or sound enamel with oct , they can be readily differentiated from wsls because areas of stain lack the subsurface triangular shaped back scattering pattern characteristic of wsls. based on the analysis focusing on the depolarization ratio of the 959 cm peak , hypocalcified enamel could not be distinguished from sound enamel. further image analysis is required to nonsubjectively distinguish sound enamel from stained and hypocalcified enamel.. statistical analysis revealed that mean raman depolarization ratios were statistically significant in all cases at p <.05 except for three cases : ( a ) sound enamel compared to hypocalcified enamel , ( b ) carious enamel compared to stained enamel , and ( c ) stained enamel from hypocalcified enamel. the statistical analyses also indicated that , based on the raman depolarization ratio , stained sound enamel can not be distinguished from hypocalcified enamel. changes in the refractive indices of structures cause light backscattering , creating an image that is different for sound enamel and demineralized enamel.. prs is a noninvasive spectroscopic method that provides details on the biochemistry and molecular structure of white spot lesions.
