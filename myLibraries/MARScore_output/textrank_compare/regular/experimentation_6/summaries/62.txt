two additional tt were performed in a cool condition ( ttc , see following section ) before and after the heat intervention and were averaged to represent ttc ( no difference in power output between them ). power output and speed during the tt were measured with powertap wheel sets ( powertap , madison , wi ) logged continuously on garmin devices ( garmin 705 edge ) and afterwards extracted with the software trainingpeaks and exported in 1hz resolution for subsequent average by 10% of the tt. two additional tt were performed in a cool condition ( ttc , see following section ) before and after the heat intervention and were averaged to represent ttc ( no difference in power output between them ). power output and speed during the tt were measured with powertap wheel sets ( powertap , madison , wi ) logged continuously on garmin devices ( garmin 705 edge ) and afterwards extracted with the software trainingpeaks and exported in 1hz resolution for subsequent average by 10% of the tt. two additional tt were performed in a cool condition ( ttc , see following section ) before and after the heat intervention and were averaged to represent ttc ( no difference in power output between them ). power output and speed during the tt were measured with powertap wheel sets ( powertap , madison , wi ) logged continuously on garmin devices ( garmin 705 edge ) and afterwards extracted with the software trainingpeaks and exported in 1hz resolution for subsequent average by 10% of the tt. however , power output during tth1 became and remained lower than both those during ttc and tth3 from 30% of the distance covered onward ( p < 0.01 ) and lower than that during tth2 from 80% onward ( fig. power output during tth2 became lower than that during ttc from 50% of the distance covered onward ( fig. power output during tth3 was lower than that during ttc in one segment of the tt only ( i.e. , 70% , fig.
