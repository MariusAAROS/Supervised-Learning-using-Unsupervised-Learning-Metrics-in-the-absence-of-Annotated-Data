we could not identify any other reported cases of chylous ascites after robot assisted donor nephrectomy [ 2 , 47 ]. in this case report , we describe the first reported complication of chylous ascites after total robot assisted donor nephrectomy. donor nephrectomy was performed by a transplant surgeon and assisted by a second transplant surgeon , as described elsewhere [ 2 , 3 ]. a review of the literature resulted in a total of 56 reported cases of chylous ascites after donor nephrectomy ( supplement 1 ). a huge. contrast has been compared with the thousands of live donor nephrectomies that have been published over the years. this complication usually occurs during abdominal aortic surgery and is an unusual complication following live donor nephrectomy. live kidney donors are healthy individuals who willingly undergo major surgery to improve the well being of another individual.
