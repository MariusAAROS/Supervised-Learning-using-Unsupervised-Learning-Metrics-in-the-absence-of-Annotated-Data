the shape of the curve grows wide with the increasing of crack length in front of crack tip a. the effect of stress distribution in front of crack can be converted into basic parameters that show the impact of crack behaviour , that is , the stress concentration factor ( scf ). according to the observations shown in figure 4. , there was a significant change of crack length as a consequence of fatigue test. a gap of about 25 m in crack length before and after cyclic load was found due to the weakened structure of material. another thing to note is the gap difference of sif for crack lengths 57 m and 60 m. this difference could be explained by the appearance of the previously mentioned debonding areas. postmortem analysis of the fracture surfaces emphasized the uniformity of the zinc layer over the steel surface and provided accurate information related to the average of cracks length ( figure 4 ). if we consider a smaller thickness , for example , the size of layer measured under he360dr b9 material , and we adopt in the numerical model the critical size of crack detected after the loading test ( see figure 4 ) , it will be obvious that the crack will cross all the coating substrate. an initial length of crack and the maximum length of crack ( see figure 4 ) were imposed as constraint in the numerical program.
