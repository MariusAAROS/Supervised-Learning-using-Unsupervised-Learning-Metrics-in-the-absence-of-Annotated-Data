echocardiography ( echo ) done in may of 2014 had revealed critical as with aortic valve area of 0.6 0.7 centimeter square and ejection fraction of 65 percent. medical therapy alone is not effective for the long term management of aortic valve disease , thus valve replacement remains the standard of care in patients with an acceptable risk profile. as a result , since the triangular orifice area of the normal ( adult ) aortic valve is approximately 3.0 cm , an area exceeding 0.75 cm would not be defined as critical. awareness amongst physicians about the fact that all critical aortic stenosis with chest pain may not require aortic valve replacement is important. as is the most common cause of left ventricular outflow obstruction in children and adults. it is most common type of valvular heart disease in europe and north america , occurring in 27% of the population over 65 years of age. we present a case of critical as with significant symptom manifested as chest pain that was managed successfully without surgical avr or tavr.
