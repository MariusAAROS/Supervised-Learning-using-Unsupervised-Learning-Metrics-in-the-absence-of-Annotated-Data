in patients with bone ce. , bone tissue destruction develops through 3 mechanisms ; as the consequence of the cystic lesion expansion and its compression on surrounding tissues , ischemic processes through compression and obstruction of nutrient vessels , and cellular processes like osteoclast proliferation around the compressed bone tissue. symptoms associated with bone ce are not specific and often missing , making the diagnosis difficult and sometimes overlooked. in patients with bone ce ,. interestingly , in our study , 1 male patient was reported with bone ce and tuberculosis super infection. data from the literature reported that the recurrence rate of bone ce , even after several operations , varied from 30% to 100%. however , some authors report that around 30 45% of bone hydatidosis is co present with the hydatid cysts in other localizations. the aim of this retrospective study was to investigate the skeletal manifestations of hydatid disease in serbia , it 's demographic distribution , site involvement , complications , and bone tissue comorbidities.
