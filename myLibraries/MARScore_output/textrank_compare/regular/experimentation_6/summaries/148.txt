the lowest film thickness generates smaller polymerization shrinkage , reducing the possibility of gaps formation and premature marginal leakage.5,6 the difference in the cement formulations that change the viscosity is related to the proportion between resin matrix and filler particle content.7 high volume fraction of fillers can increase the viscosity and the elastic modulus and strength of composites.7,8 low viscosity or flowable resins and resin cements present lower filler loading than regular restorative materials. the dc of resin cements was higher when the materials were light cured and when the low viscosity versions were used than when self curing mode and the high viscosity resin cements were tested , respectively ( p<.05 ). the results of this study showed that the curing mode ( auto and dual polymerization ) , the viscosity ( low or high ) and the evaluation time ( 5 minutes or 24 hours ) influenced the dc of resin cements. as the dc is dependent on the monomeric composition and the concentration and type of the photoinitiator in each product,9,17 the statistical analysis comparing the dc between resin cements. dual polymerizing resin cements have been extensively used for placement of indirect restorations and posts. although many researchers have evaluated the polymerization effectiveness to determine the physical and mechanical properties of dental materials,9,15,16 little information is known about the influence of different viscosities of dual cured resin cements on their physical properties , such as the degree of conversion in situations of self and dual polymerization. low viscosity materials can be due to lower filler loading and/or higher addition low viscosity diluents monomers.
