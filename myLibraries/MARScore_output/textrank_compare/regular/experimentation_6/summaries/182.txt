rs3751142 ( c > a ) in p2x7r gene and rs2043211(a > t ) in card8 gene. however , our study revealed no association of card8 rs2043211 with the presence of gout in korean study population. rs3751142 and card8 rs2043211 genotype influenced the risk of gout development compared to those in controls. rs3751142 and card8 rs2043211 genotype influenced the risk of gout development compared to those in controls. clinical and laboratory variables , including age at the time of study , disease onset age , body mass index ( bmi ) , disease duration , and serum uric acid level were identified by individual interviews with each patient and medical record review. clinical and laboratory variables , including age at the time of study , disease onset age , body mass index ( bmi ) , disease duration , and serum uric acid level were identified by individual interviews with each patient and medical record review. the nlrp3 inflammasome , a member of the nlr family , is a key player in the production of uric acid mediated il1 and is an important cytoplasmic protein complex involved in gouty inflammation ( 12 ).
