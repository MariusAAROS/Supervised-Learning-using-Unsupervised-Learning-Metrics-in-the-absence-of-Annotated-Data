although she had hypoglycemia every 2 or 3 weeks and experienced a few episodes of hypoglycemia with mental change during insulin treatment , there was no more hypoglycemia after changing to su treatment. on the contrary , loss of function mutations cause congenital hyperinsulinemia due to the closure of the katp channel and lead to increased insulin secretion.. sulfonylureas ( su ) can close the katp channel and increase insulin secretion4 ). encoding the sulfonylurea receptor 1 ( sur1 ) of atp sensitive potassium ( katp ) channel , which has a key role in insulin secretion in glucose metabolism , are the most common causes and account for approximately 40% of all cases of pndm12 ). glucose increases intracellular atp level and it induces the closure of katp channels that lead to insulin secretion by pancreatic beta cells. activating mutations in the kcnj11 or abcc8 gene of katp channel lead to katp channels remaining open despite the presence of glucose , thus , insulin secretion can not be increased1 ). oral glucose tolerance test in index patient showed improvement in insulin secretion during the treatment at 6 months and 12 months after the use of su. there were no differences in blood insulin , c peptide level , and insulin injection dose between the successful group and unsuccessful group.
