p53 inhibits the activation of nrf2 target genes by direct interacting with are containing promoters or activating p21.21 considering that p53induced apoptosis requires the accumulation of ros , increased activity of antioxidant genes by nrf2 in cancer cells can inhibit p53 dependent apoptosis. neh1 has dna binding motifs.6 neh3 , neh4 , and neh5 have domains involved in the transactivation of nrf2 target genes by binding coactivators. nrf2 target genes include antioxidant genes and phase ii enzymes such as heme oxygenase1 ( ho1 ) , nad(p)h : quinone oxidoreductase 1 ( nqo1 ) , glutathione s transferase ( gst ) , and glutathione peroxidases. nrf2 target genes , including ho1 have been reported to negatively affect nfb activation.19,20 p53 has been reported to suppress the nrf2dependent transcription of antioxidant response genes by directly interacting with are containing promoters. as p62 could block binding between nrf2 and keap1 , p62 contributes to the activation of nrf2 target genes in response to oxidative stress creating a positive feedback loop.23. the association of nrf2 overexpression and chemoresistance has been reported in many cancers including non small cell lung cancer , stomach cancer , endometrial cancer , and osteosarcoma.2427 overexpression of nrf2 target genes was also found in a variety of solid tumors.28 ho1 overexpression was found in brain cancer , prostate cancer , and renal cancer.29,30 nqo1 is known to be overexpressed in hepatoblastoma , colon cancer , breast cancer , and non small cell lung cancer.31 several mechanisms have been proposed for the activation of keap1nrf2 signaling in cancer. several chemopreventive agents , such as sulforaphane , epigallocatechin3gallate , and curcumin , induce nrf2 signaling with concomitant repression of nfb.14 the nfb p65 subunit re presses the nrf2are pathway by preventing creb binding protein ( cbp ) from binding nrf2 through competitive interaction or by promoting the recruitment of histone deacetylase 3 ( hdac3 ) , a corepressor , to the are.17 in chondrocyte apoptosis , shear induced cyclooxygenase2 , an nkb target gene , can suppress phosphatidyl inositol 3kinase ( pi3k ) activity , causing a reduction in thenrf2mediated transcriptional response.18 in contrast , nrf2 inhibits the activity of nfb by attenuating phosphorylated ib.
