there were 48 cases of benign diagnoses , including 29 follicular adenomas ( fas ) , 19 adenomatous nodules ( an ) , and 43 malignant diagnoses , including 13 follicular carcinomas ( ftcs ) , 24 papillary carcinomas ( ptcs ) , 1 poorly differentiated carcinoma , 2 c cell carcinomas , and 3 malignant lymphomas. in japan , all patients with indeterminate cytology undergo further diagnostic procedures , without immediate surgery , to search for higher risk patients who should undergo surgery [ 79 , 1315 ]. there were 91 ( 23.4% ) surgically treated patients with thyroid nodule under indeterminate cytological diagnoses. we propose that future thyroid cytology classification schemes should reconsider clinical managements of indeterminate categories and how to reduce unnecessary surgeries for patients with benign thyroid nodules [ 79 ]. the national cancer institute ( nci ) of the united states of america has proposed a reporting system for thyroid fine needle aspiration ( fna ) cytology , so called bethesda system , which became an international standard of thyroid cytology [ 1 , 2 ]. following this recommendation , the uk royal college of pathologists ( the uk system ) [ 3 , 4 ] and italian societies of endocrinology and the italian society for anatomic pathology and cytology joint with the italian division of the international academy of pathology ( the italian system )
