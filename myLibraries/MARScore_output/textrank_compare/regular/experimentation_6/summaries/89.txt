five tissues were used for rna seq analysis with ~10 million illumina 36 bp reads per library ( table s12 ). five tissues were used for rna seq analysis with ~10 million illumina 36 bp reads per library ( table s12 ). three tissues were used for small rna analysis with ~3 million reads per illumina library ( figures s17s18 , table s16 , datafile s9 ). three tissues were used for small rna analysis with ~3 million reads per illumina library ( figures s17s18 , table s16 , datafile s9 ). sequences were downloaded in february / march 2009 with scaffolding performed by aligning all bac and fosmid ends against contigs and then anchored and ordered primarily by optical mapping. sequences were downloaded in february / march 2009 with scaffolding performed by aligning all bac and fosmid ends against contigs and then anchored and ordered primarily by optical mapping. six a17 bac and one fosmid library were used to create mt3.5 ( table s1 ).
