work to date on ant134 satisfies certain recommendations for testing and evaluating novel therapies for epilepsy , with seizure suppressive effects demonstrated in five different models and two different species.1 , 2 , 43 , 44 there are , however , additional seizure models that could be used during any future pre clinical development. analysis of the hippocampus obtained after ptz induced seizures confirmed that mir134 expression was lower in ant134 pre treated mice compared to scr treated animals ( figure 3a ). ptz induced seizures were defined as high amplitude ( > 2 baseline ) high frequency ( > 5 hz ) polyspike discharges lasting > 5 s. for statistical purposes , we assigned a cut off time of 1,800 s for those animals that did not present seizures during the observation period. to obtain molecular evidence for ptz induced seizure activity in the model , we measured expression of activity regulated genes in the hippocampus. epilepsy is a common and serious chronic neurological disease that affects over 50 million people worldwide. anti epileptic drugs ( aeds ) are effective at controlling seizures in many patients , acting through a range of neuronal targets , including ion channels , neurotransmitter release , and receptor mechanisms.1 , 2 however , a third of patients with epilepsy fail to achieve seizure freedom , and current aeds do not show disease modifying properties. future treatments for epilepsy need to differentiate from currently marketed drugs , for example , by having a novel mechanism(s ) of action or providing disease modifying effects.1 , 2 acquired epilepsy is thought to result from disturbances to the expression and function of neurotransmitters and their receptors , ion channels , and signaling components , as well as altered metabolism , neuronal and glial microstructure , neuroinflammation , and other mechanisms.3 , 4 , 5 it is likely that disease modifying treatments will need to influence multiple genes within a given pathway or in various independent pathways.
