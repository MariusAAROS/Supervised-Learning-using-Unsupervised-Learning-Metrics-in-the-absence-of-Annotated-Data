multivariate logistic regression models for bp variability were built to determine which variables were independently associated with this status. circadian bp profile and bp variability assessed by 24hour mean bps variation were increased in hypertensive patients , especially in hypertensive obese patients , without gender difference ( all p 's < 0.05 ). although circadian bp profile and bp variability were increased in hypertensive obese patients without gender differences , female patients had significantly higher eft and greater daytime bp variability than male subjects. bp variability was associated with sbp and eft only in female patients ; therefore , eft may be a more valuable parameter in the evaluation of bp severity and obesity in women than in men. , we investigated the relationship between the parameters derived from 24hour abpm ( 24hour sbp and dbp , and bp variability ) in nondiabetic hypertensive patients with or without obesity. regarding gender differences , obese females showed a higher tendency towards bp variability than obese males. one interesting finding was that females showed a significant relationship between increased eft , obesity , and bp variability , but this was not the case in males.
