the median os of patients with recurrent disease was only 1.0 year ( 95% ci , 0.81.2 years ) for tnbc patients , significantly shorter than the median os of 2.3 years ( 95% ci , 1.92.7 years ) for those with other breast cancer subtypes ( hr , 2.5 ; 95% ci , 1.83.5 ; p < 0.001 ). most notably , survival outcomes were almost identical between tnbc patients and those with hormone receptor positive disease. additionally , severe adverse events appeared to be less frequent in the overall study population relative to results in other published chemotherapy studies in patients with metastatic breast cancer. this work reports on a patient with metastatic tnbc enrolled in this phase ii study of nab paclitaxel , bevacizumab , and gemcitabine who experienced a long term complete remission lasting just under 2 years and a pfs from diagnosis of nearly 3 years. patients with metastatic tnbc have a very poor prognosis. while median os has not been specifically assessed in a large patient population initially presenting with metastatic tnbc , it is likely to be similarly poor. there is an unmet clinical need for effective therapies that prolong survival for patients with metastatic tnbc.
