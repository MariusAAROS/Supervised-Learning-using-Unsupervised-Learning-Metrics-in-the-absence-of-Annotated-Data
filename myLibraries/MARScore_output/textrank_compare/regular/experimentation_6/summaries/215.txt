the s100 positivity indicates myoepithelial cells , while epithelial glandular cells are negative for s100 protein expression. we describe a cutaneous neoplasm composed of myoepithelial cells and a focal epithelial and glandular component. while myoepithelioma is defined as a benign neoplasm consisting exclusively of myoepithelial cells embedded in a myxoid stroma , adenomyoepithelioma shows in addition to myoepithelial cells a second component displaying various degrees of epithelial ductal differentiation. , the predominance of myoepithelial cells in relation to ductal epithelial structures lacking features of follicular and/or sebaceous differentiation separates this neoplasm from mixed apocrine tumor. pleomorphic adenoma in the breast is regarded as the analogue to mixed apocrine tumor in the skin , while adenomyoepithelioma of the breast is defined as a neoplasm with nodular aggregations of clear myoepithelial cells that surround epithelial lined tubules. at higher magnification , most of the cells that constituted the lesion displayed myoepithelial differentiation with polygonal and plasmacytoid features ( figure 2 ). based on findings by conventional microscopy and immunohistochemistry , this neoplasm shows myoepithelial differentiation and focal epithelial lined tubules with features of apocrine secretion , findings that are consistent with the diagnosis of primary adenomyoepithelioma of the skin.
