we performed sympathetic nerve reconstruction surgery using intercostal nerve in 19 patients with severe compensatory hyperhidrosis after endoscopic thoracic sympathetic surgery and evaluated the results of the procedure. we reviewed the clinical charts of all patients who underwent sympathetic nerve reconstruction surgery using the intercostal nerve. r3 intercostal nerve was used for sympathetic nerve reconstruction surgery in 15 patients , r4 intercostal nerve in 2 , r2 intercostal nerve in 1 , and r3 with r5 intercostal nerve in 1 patient. ( 21 ) reported that sympathetic nerve reconstruction surgery using the intercostal nerve was useful after resection of the sympathetic nerve involved by tumor. first , the intercostal nerve has more sympathetic nerve fibers than the sural nerve , hence the intercostal nerve is more appropriate for sympathetic nerve reconstruction surgery. thoracoscopic intercostal nerve could be harvested in all patients except 1 patient with severe pleural adhesion , leading us to believe that the intercostal nerve is a useful graft for sympathetic nerve reconstruction surgery. if microscopic suture technique is used in sympathetic nerve reconstruction surgery , it inevitably needs thoracotomy.
