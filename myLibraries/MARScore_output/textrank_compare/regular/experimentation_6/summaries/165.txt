subjects were categorized into five exposure cohorts : nonexposed cohort , fetal exposed cohort , early childhood exposed cohort , mid childhood exposed cohort , and late childhood exposed cohort. subjects were categorized into five exposure cohorts : nonexposed cohort , fetal exposed cohort , early childhood exposed cohort , mid childhood exposed cohort , and late childhood exposed cohort. mean ages for subjects in nonexposed cohort , fetal exposed cohort , early childhood exposed cohort , mid childhood exposed cohort , and late childhood exposed cohort were 39 , 42 , 45 , 47 , and 49 years , respectively. subjects who were born between october 1 , 1962 , and september 30 , 1964 , were classified as the nonexposed cohort ; and subjects who were born between october 1 , 1959 , and september 30 , 1961 , were classified as fetal exposed cohort. mean ages for subjects in nonexposed cohort , fetal exposed cohort , early childhood exposed cohort , mid childhood exposed cohort , and late childhood. subjects who were born between october 1 , 1962 , and september 30 , 1964 , were classified as the nonexposed cohort ; and subjects who were born between october 1 , 1959 , and september 30 , 1961 , were classified as fetal exposed cohort. rich environment did not match the fetal starvation environment that people of fetal exposed cohort experienced , which in turn increased the risk of hyperglycemia in later life ( 1,20,23 ).
