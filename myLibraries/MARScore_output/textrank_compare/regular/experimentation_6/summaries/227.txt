those treated with the inhibitor had longer survival and less change in body temperature.3 in a cellular model described in the same citation , human umbilical vein cells from ad hies patients or control cells treated with a stat3 inhibitor demonstrated aberrant responses to mast cell mediators , such as histamine or platelet activating factor. basophils from hies patients were less sensitive to ige cross linking than basophils from non allergic subjects.4 this study demonstrates that among the pediatric cases identified , there have been no cases of anaphylaxis among the hies patients. the authors found that in a murine model of mast cell degranulation , mast cell induced anaphylaxis was blunted in the mutant mice. a clinical study of food allergies and adult hies conducted a clinical evaluation of food allergies in a cohort of 71 patients with ad hies compared with healthy control subjects ( n=41 ) and atopic subjects ( n=65 ). the results indicated that fewer patients with ad hies developed food allergies and anaphy laxis than atopic patients with marked serum ige elevation , eczema , and no stat3 mutations. the study reported that fewer patients with ad hies had anaphylaxis to a food allergen than atopic controls ( 8.5% vs. 33.3% ). job syndrome is one of the hyper immunoglobulin e ( ige ) syndrome ( hies ) conditions characterized by signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( stat3 ) signaling mutations.
