inferior dislocations are rare ( 0.5% of all shoulder dislocations ) and bilateral inferior shoulder dislocations are exceptional : only 10 cases have been described so far in the literature. neurovascular damages are also commonly associated with inferior shoulder dislocation [ 5 , 7 ] ; garcia et al. described a case of bilateral luxatio erecta complicated by an axillary vein thrombosis. an x ray examination was performed showing a bilateral inferior dislocation of humeral heads in relation with the glenoid fossa ; no fracture was associated ( fig. 1 ). the clinical manifestation is typical and it is characterized by abduction of the affected arm , flexion of the elbow and pronation of the forearm. bilateral luxatio erecta represents an extremely rare condition , and just a few cases were reported in medical literature. because of a high incidence of related complications such as neurovascular damages early recognition and treatment of this type of dislocation is required by physicians. in this article.
