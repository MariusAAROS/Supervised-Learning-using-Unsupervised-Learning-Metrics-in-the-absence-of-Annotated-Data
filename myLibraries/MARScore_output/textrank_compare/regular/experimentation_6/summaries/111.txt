as three of these conserved residues were histidines , it has been hypothesized that rhomboid family proteins could function as metal dependent membrane proteases. thus , it appears that rhomboid family proteins are a distinct group of intramembrane serine proteases. , two independent research groups have shown that several bacterial rhomboid family proteins , including aara , can cleave the egf receptor ligands ( spitz , keren and gurken ) that are normally cleaved by rho paralogs. eukaryotic rhomboid family proteins seem to show considerable functional variability ; in particular , cross talk might exist between different rip pathways. the proteins in this group of eukaryotic rhomboids , which we designated the rho subfamily , typically have an extra tmh added carboxy terminally to the 6tmh core ; some of these proteins also contain ef hand calcium binding domains amino terminally of the core ( figure 2 ). thus , the existence of two distinct subfamilies of eukaryotic rhomboids is supported by features of domain architectures that appear to comprise shared derived characters. the tree produced using the mrbayes package showed the same major clades as the tree in figure 2 ( data not shown ) ; moreover , clustering of the rho and parl subfamilies of eukaryotic rhomboids with the respective prokaryotic clades was supported by high posterior probabilities ( figure 2 ).
