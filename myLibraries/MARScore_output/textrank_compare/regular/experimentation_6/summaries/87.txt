to adjust for treatment induced changes in gfr and the potential influence on albuminuria reduction , we calculated fractional clearance , which was reduced by 46% versus placebo during aliskiren treatment ( p = 0.021 ) , by 56% versus placebo during irbesartan treatment ( p = 0.002 ) , and by 67% versus placebo during combination treatment ( p = 0.001 ). when the albuminuria reduction was adjusted during combination treatment for changes in gfr ( fractional clearance ) , it was 11% higher than during irbesartan treatment , a nonsignificant change that was possibly due to a small sample number. aliskiren treatment led to a significant reduction in albuminuria by 48% ( 95% ci 2762 ) compared with placebo ( p < 0.001 ) but not significantly different from irbesartan , lowering uaer by 58% ( 4270 ) other statistically significant changes from placebo levels were a 6% reduction in soluble intracellular adhesion molecule1 ( p = 0.017 ) observed with the combination treatment and a 7% reduction in fibrinogen during aliskiren treatment ( p = 0.037 ). the patient experienced sudden cardiac arrest , seemingly after a myocardial infarction during aliskiren treatment. ( 12 ) have shown that aliskiren treatment increases renal plasma flow to a larger extent than the ace inhibitor captopril. such marked increases in renin during aliskiren treatment have been noted before ( 18 ).
