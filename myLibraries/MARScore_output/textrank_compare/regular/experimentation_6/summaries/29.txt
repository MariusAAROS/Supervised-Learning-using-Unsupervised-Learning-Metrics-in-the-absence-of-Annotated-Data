the demographic , anthropometric and clinical data for all participants in the study , grouped based on the presence ( vertebral fracture ) or absence of vertebral fractures ( no vertebral fracture ) , are shown in table 1. however , that study was not designed to assess the impact of vertebral fractures on quality of life , and the number of women with fractures was too small to enable an accurate assessment ( 18 ). indeed , in studies based on the radiographic screening of populations , the incidence of all vertebral fractures has been estimated to be three times higher than the incidence of hip fractures , and only 30% of people with vertebral fractures were found to have received medical attention ( 12 ). the qualeffo , a specific tool used to evaluate subjects with vertebral fractures and that includes questions on pain , physical functioning , social functioning , general health perception and mental functioning , has been shown to be repeatable and consistent ( 7 8 ). vertebral fractures are the most frequent osteoporotic fractures , occurring in at least 30% of the elderly population ( 9 ) , and have important clinical implications ( 10 14 ). only one third of vertebral fractures are symptomatic ; therefore , patients may be unaware of their presence. women with vertebral fractures can also experience decreased hrqol due to physical limitations and psychosocial disabilities ( 13 14 ).
