brachial plexus surgery using the da vinci surgical robot is a new procedure. robotic surgery will be used routinely in the future for brachial plexus surgery and particularly for tos that is caused by bone and/or soft tissue. to our knowledge , this report is the first to objectively describe robotic axillar brachial plexus exposure. it can also occur with tos , which encompasses three separate disorders involving compression of the subclavian artery , subclavian vein , or brachial plexus in the triangular space bordered by the first rib , clavicle , and scalene muscles [ 9 , 10 ]. techniques were considered more useful for lower brachial plexus viewing and assessing according to gharagozloo et al. to evaluate the advantages and the restrictions of the technique , a cadaveric study of supraclavicular and axillary approaches was conducted. we found that the axillary approach was useful and advantageous for lower roots , particularly for thoracic outlet syndrome ( tos ).
