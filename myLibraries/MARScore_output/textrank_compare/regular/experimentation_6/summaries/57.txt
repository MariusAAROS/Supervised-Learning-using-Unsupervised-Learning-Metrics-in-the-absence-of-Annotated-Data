edi oct appears to be an excellent technique for measuring choroidal nevi and all choroidal lesions accessible to oct imaging by depicting their exact location in the choroid , their dimensions , and their demarcation from the surrounding healthy tissue , thus allowing for a more efficient and accurate follow up. in a 60year old woman with an asymptomatic choroidal nevus , normal oct was used to observe the macula and edi oct to image the choroidal nevus that was inaccessible to ultrasound. edi oct appears to be an excellent technique for evaluating flat choroidal nevi that are inaccessible to ultrasound sonography and accessible to oct imaging , displaying simultaneously the lesion and the retinal changes. , enhanced depth imaging oct ( edi oct ) has been used in order to measure choroidal thickness in normal and pathologic eyes [ 3 , 4 ]. , we report a case of a flat choroidal nevus inaccessible to ultrasound sonography that was evaluated by edi oct. the flat nevus was inaccessible to ultrasound sonography , and edi oct was used to image its posterior surface ( fig. edi oct is a new technique that consists of positioning a heidelberg sd oct close enough to the eye in order to obtain an inverted image , averaged for 100 scans.
