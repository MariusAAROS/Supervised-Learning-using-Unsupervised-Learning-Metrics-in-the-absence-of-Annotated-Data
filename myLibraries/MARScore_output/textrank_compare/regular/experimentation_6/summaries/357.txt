bostock et al12 demonstrated that potassium channel blockers dendrotoxin and 4aminopyridine improved conduction impairments in experimentally demyelinated axons and laid the scientific rationale for clinical studies of potassium channel blockers in ms patients. , dalfampridine passes through the blood brain barrier and blocks potassium channels in both the central and peripheral nervous systems.15 daldampridine binds reversibly to the cytoplasmic side of potassium channels , blocking the ion conductance pathway which in turn prolongs the action potentials in unmyelinated nerve fibers and enhances neurotransmitter release at synaptic endings.16 dalfampridine has been studied extensively in symptomatic treatment of ms patients with walking impairment. 4aminopyridine has been used as an experimental agent which presumably enhances nerve conduction of demyelinated axons through its effects on potassium channels for treatment of fatigue in ms. sheean et al22 reported that use of fampridine in ms patients was associated with improvements in fatigue as well motor and visual symptoms. pharmacological agents which block potassium channels have been investigated in the context of clinical trials with positive impact on impulse conduction in experimentally induced demyelination as well as in patients with ms. dalfampridine ( which is marketed as ampyra ) , is an extended release form of fampridine ( 4aminopyridine ) , which has been recently approved by the us fda for symptomatic treatment of ms patients. in addition , dalfampridine has been assessed and studied in other cohorts of ms patients in the context of various clinical trials to determine its efficacy in improving ms patients ambulation. impairment of ambulation is a major neurological deficit in ms patients and significantly interferes with their quality of life. vollmer et al21 studied the pharmacokinetics of dalfampridine in clinical trials of ms patients and found that multiple dosing of this medication was associated with its accumulation.
