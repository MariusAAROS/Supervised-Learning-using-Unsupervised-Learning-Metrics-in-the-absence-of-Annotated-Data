more interestingly we can see that , if the increased viremia that allows for vector transmission also results in the development of aids after only 5 years as opposed to 8 years , then arthropods would need to cause a doubling of hiv transmission rate for appreciable evolution to have occurred. more interestingly we can see that , if the increased viremia that allows for vector transmission also results in the development of aids after only 5 years as opposed to 8 years , then arthropods would need to cause a doubling of hiv transmission rate for appreciable evolution to have occurred. this current belief stems both from epidemiological data and experimental studies that directly examine the potential for hiv transmission via arthropods ( lawrence 1987 ; lifson 1988 ; bockarie and paru 1996 ).. one of our aims is to stimulate future research into the evolutionary biology of hiv transmission. on the other hand , if increased viremia results in the development of aids after only 1 year , then arthropods would need to increase hiv transmission rate by 5 or 6fold for appreciable evolution to have occurred. on the other hand , if increased viremia results in the development of aids after only 1 year , then arthropods would need to increase hiv transmission rate by 5 or 6fold for appreciable evolution to have occurred. sexual transmission rate ( solid line ) and vector transmission rate ( dashed line ) as a function of viremia ,.
