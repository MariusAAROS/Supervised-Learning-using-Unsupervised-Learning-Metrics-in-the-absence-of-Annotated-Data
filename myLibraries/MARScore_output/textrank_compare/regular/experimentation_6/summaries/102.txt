the lateral aspect of the upper lid is retracted superiorly , and the periosteum of lateral orbital rim is exposed. in case of old patient with lid laxity , the canthopexy is accomplished by a 5 0 absorbable suture fixation in the direction of posterior superiorly to the periosteum of lateral orbital rim to prevent the postoperative ectropion. under general endotracheal anesthesia , a lateral canthal incision , about 1.0 2.0 cm , is made down to the periosteum of lateral orbital rim. the lateral aspect of the upper lid is retracted superiorly , and the periosteum of lateral orbital rim is exposed. in case of old patient with lid laxity , the canthopexy is accomplished by a 5 0 absorbable suture fixation in the direction of posterior superiorly to the periosteum of lateral orbital rim to prevent the postoperative ectropion. there have been subsequent reports demonstrating the efficacy of transconjunctival approach not only for the lower eyelid blepharoplasty but also for the repair of orbital fractures ( 2 5 ). since then , a few authors ( 7 9 ) have described the advantages of this type of incision , but there has been no report that describe the long term results of two point fixation through the single transconjunctival incision for the treatment of zygoma fracture.
