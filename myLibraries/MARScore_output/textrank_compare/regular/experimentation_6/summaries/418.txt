characterization of the viable s. pombe oma1d and oma4d single mutants shows that reduced o mannosylation results in abnormal cell wall and septum formation , therefore severely affecting cell morphology and cell cell separation. this signaling cascade activates the expression of genes encoding for cell wall proteins that stabilize the cell wall. however , during the past few years , it has become increasingly evident that glycosylation is vital for cell wall synthesis and thus vital for growth and morphology of a. fumigatus.. therefore , investigation of glycosylation in the multicellular fungus a. fumigatus not only helps understand the mechanism of cell wall synthesis in this species but also provides insights into the role of glycosylation in the development of multicellular eukaryotes. it is clear that glycoproteins are directly , as structural components of the cell wall , and indirectly , as enzymes required for cell wall synthesis , involved in maintaining proper cell wall architecture in a. fumigatus. the phenotypes associated with the mutant under mannose starvation are mainly due to an insufficient supply of gdp man required for cell wall synthesis. it is likely that the ams1p is involved in cell wall synthesis and thus polarity through the cwi pathway.
