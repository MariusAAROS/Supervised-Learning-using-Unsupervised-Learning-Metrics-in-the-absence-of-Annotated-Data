the cpb priming solution in pediatric patients , unlike adults , can cause blood thinning , which can lead to possible ischemic organ failure. post surgery visual loss or reduction can be caused by a variety of factors , and occurs 0.1% to 1% of cases. in addition , in patients with neural damage , there are more cases of transcranial doppler detection of microembolic signals in the right middle cerebral artery than in patients without. rodriguez and belway stated that in pediatric cardiac surgery , the likelihood of microemboli can increase with increasing time of extracorporeal circulation depending on the oxygenator , circuit , adnexa parts , and components. considerable effort is required to reduce neural sequelae after pediatric cardiac surgery , such as visual loss. a 21month old male patient , 75 cm in height and 10 kg in weight , experienced tricuspid valve regurgitation ( tvr ) and was scheduled to undergo tricuspid valve plasty. the tvr was discovered in a follow up test 1 year after he had undergone ventricular septal defect repair surgery.
