differences in cytokine profiles between baseline ( first trimester ) pregnancy samples and nonpregnant control samples could be identified by pca ( figure 1 ). an example of such a discrepancy in our study is that of ip10 , which was low in first trimester pregnancy compared to healthy controls in this cohort.. comparison of baseline ( first trimester ) and end of pregnancy levels of cytokines / growth factors was carried out between the 16 primigravid subjects and the 11 nonpregnant control subjects using the kruskal wallis tests. the role of il9 , which has historically been categorized as a th2 cytokine prior to the recognition of ilc , is currently unknown in normal pregnancy. pregnancy clearly alters the maternal immune milieu , but the changes from baseline in the setting of normal pregnancy are subtle and more variable in some women than in others. , it must develop tolerance to paternal antigens to avoid a lethal immunologic attack against the fetus. on the other hand.
