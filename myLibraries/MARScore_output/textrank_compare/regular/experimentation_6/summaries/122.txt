msp results were analyzed as a dichotomous variable based on the presence or absence of gene methylation. msp results were analyzed as a dichotomous variable based on the presence or absence of gene methylation. the results of the present study demonstrate the substantially increased frequency of promoter hypermethylation in id4 , sfrp1 , and shp1 genes in aml compared to cml. methylation frequencies of shp1 gene were the high detected in cml as well as aml. also , the hypermethylation of shp1 gene was frequently detected in several human cancers and the reduced expression of the shp1 gene in various types of leukemias and lymphomas mainly occurred by promoter methylation ( 26 28 ). therefore , these results indicate that aberrant dna methylation of shp1 gene may be related to the tumorigenicity of myeloid leukemia. genomic dna hypomethylation has been observed in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of leukemia patients and in tumor cells of patients with b cell lymphoproliferative diseases ( 1 ).
