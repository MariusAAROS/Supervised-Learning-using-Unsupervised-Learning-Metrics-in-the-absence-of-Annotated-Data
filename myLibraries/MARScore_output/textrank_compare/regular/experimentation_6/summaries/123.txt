previous authors have described similar cases of extra articular lateral patellar dislocation with vertical axis rotation and have noted in their subsequent reviews of the limited literature that intra aritcular dislocations were usually related to far more significant trauma than extra articular dislocations [ 3 10 ]. we would recommend a low threshold for open reduction in such cases by a specialist knee surgeon who may assess and reconstruct damaged soft tissue damage in one operation vertical axis rotation is a rare entity complicating patella dislocations. we feel this may be an indication of the chronic deficiency in the mpfl likely contributing to cases of extra articular dislocation. on reviewing the previous cases of extra articular dislocation in the literature. acute patellar dislocation is a common injury usually associated with a significant traumatic mechanism resulting in lateral displacement. vertical axis rotation following dislocation is a rare variant of this type of injury and can prevent closed reduction in the acute setting. a 32year old gentleman presented with an irreducible patella dislocation following an unusual atraumatic mechanism.
