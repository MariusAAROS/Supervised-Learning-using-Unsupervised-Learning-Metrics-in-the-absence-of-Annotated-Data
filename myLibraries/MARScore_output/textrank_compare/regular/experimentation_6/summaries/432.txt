35 articles ( 25,4% ) did not undergo detailed analysis because there was no reference to the type of pvr classification used by the authors or because no classification was used ( generic terms such as initial or severe pvr or simply pvr were adopted , without using any grading system ). there is a clinical impression that over the last 15 years clinicians have abandoned current pvr classifications. furthermore , current classifications are not prognostic and do not correlate with visual prognosis or anatomical success after surgical treatment.. classification was then updated in 1991 according to modifications proposed by the silicone study group and also by other authors ( table 3 ). proliferative vitreoretinopathy ( pvr ) remains the major complication after retinal detachment surgery [ 13 ]. pvr was identified as an independent clinical entity in 1983 by the retina society terminology committee and a classification was created , based on the condition formerly named massive vitreous traction or massive periretinal proliferation [ 57 ]. this classification divided pvr into four stages , a , b , c , and d , apparently by increasing its severity , from minimal to massive pvr ( table 1 ).
