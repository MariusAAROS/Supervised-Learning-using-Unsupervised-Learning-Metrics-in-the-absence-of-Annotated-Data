we first calculated the range of nucleosome occupancy values for all loci studied on a per chromosome basis for each post kshv reactivation timepoint ( fig.. these results comport with our previous observation that the greatest positioning occurs at the 24 hour timepoint , however do not indicate chromosome specificity with respect to increased positioning. we first calculated the range of nucleosome occupancy values for all loci studied on a per chromosome basis for each post kshv reactivation timepoint ( fig.. these results comport with our previous observation that the greatest positioning occurs at the 24 hour timepoint , however do not indicate chromosome specificity with respect to increased positioning. we discovered that nucleosome occupancy values change in a chromosome specific manner ( fig.. chromosomes 18 , 19 , and 22 show the greatest median nucleosome occupancy values at the 24 hour timepoint. most of the ranges of nucleosome occupancy values are not statistically significantly different from one another ( fig. we discovered that nucleosome occupancy values change in a chromosome specific manner ( fig.. chromosomes 18 , 19 , and 22 show the greatest median nucleosome occupancy values at the 24 hour timepoint. most of the ranges of nucleosome occupancy values are not statistically significantly different from one another ( fig. finally , we analyzed the nucleosome distribution changes at the 24 hour timepoint on a per chromosome basis , by calculating the t statistic and p value ( assuming unequal variance ) for the pairwise comparison of the range of values between all chromosomes.
