the mean visual acuity of patients was 0.32 0.28 logmar and 0.27 0.23 logmar in red laser group and green laser group , respectively. to the best of our knowledge , no other study has compared these two laser modalities in changing choroidal or central retinal thickness. spectral domain optical coherence tomography images were obtained using spectralis oct ( heidelberg engineering , heidelberg , germany ) to measure central retinal thickness and enhanced depth imaging ( edi ) mode to measure subfoveal choroidal thickness. also , we did not find any correlation between changes of choroidal thickness and central retinal thickness. laser setting parameters did not differ significantly between two groups ( mean power 303 mwatts in red and 290 mwatts in green laser group , p value : 0.14 ; mean laser spots 1789 spots in red and 1869 spots in green laser group , p value : 0.13 ). in green laser group , the mean central retinal thickness was 267.0 36.9 micron at baseline and 306.4 73.3 micron at week 6 of follow up , ( p value 0.000 for both groups ). in green laser group , it was 103.5 19.8 micron at baseline which increased to 112.7 22.9 in week 6 of follow up ( p value 0.000 )
