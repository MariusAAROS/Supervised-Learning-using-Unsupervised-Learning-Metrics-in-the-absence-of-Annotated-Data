the efficiency of test tools was calculated as ( total positive cases / total number of cases ) 100. the efficiency of test tools was calculated as ( total positive cases / total number of cases ) 100. hence , among all 55 cases , 45 ( 82% ) cases were tb positive test and 10 ( 18% ) were negative by all tests carried out ( zn microscopy , bactec culture and histopathology ). hence , among all 55 cases , 45 ( 82% ) cases were tb positive test and 10 ( 18% ) were negative by all tests carried out ( zn microscopy , bactec culture and histopathology ). in cases of no improvements or hepatotoxicity ,. in cases of no improvements or hepatotoxicity ,. an earlier report by jain et al.17 found 14.8% positivity on zn microscopy and 11.11% positivity on culture method in cases of spinal tb.
