as animal models have proven , even partial outlet obstruction can lead to structural and functional deterioration in the detrusor muscle and bladder if the obstruction is not released soon enough [ 9 11 ] , which indicates the need for close follow up after valve ablation. a foley catheter was left in place and was removed 24 to 48 hours after valve ablation. we performed cystoscopy in all patients at a follow up session , at least 3 months after valve ablation ( range , 3 12 months ). other clinical data that we assessed demonstrated no significant differences in children with and without remnant leaflets after valve ablation and are summarized in table 1. some investigators suggest vcug to confirm the adequacy of valve ablation , whereas others recommend cystoscopy follow up in all patients. given that there are no quantitative guidelines for the adequacy of valve ablation , our criterion was no visible obstructive residual valves in follow up cystoscopy. even though controversy exists about the role of age ( at diagnosis and time of puv surgery ) , it has been mentioned as one of the predictive factors for renal outcome after valve ablation.
