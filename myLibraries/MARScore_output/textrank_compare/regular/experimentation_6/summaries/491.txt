reported that korean g. lucidum ( asi7004 ) could be clustered into one group together with chinese g. lucidum and g. lingzhi based on the its2 sequences and rna secondary structures. with regard to the morphological characteristics , it has been reported that chinese g. lucidum ( g. lingzhi ) has a yellow pore surface , european g. lucidum has a white pore surface , and korean g. lucidum has pale brownish thread like tissues in the middle of the context. the results of this study also reveal that korean g. lucidum was clustered into one group together with chinese g. sichuanense and chinese g. lingzhi ( both formerly g. lucidum ) , and it was clearly separated from g. lucidum from europe and north america. it is worth noting that other g. lucidum strains from europe ( france , finland , italy , sweden , and uk ) and canada could be clustered into group g with g. tsugae strains from north america ( canada and usa ) , supported by a very high bootstrap value of 99%. group a included all the korean g. lucidum strains , as well as the g. lucidum strains from bangladesh and japan , and chinese g. sichuanense and g. lingzhi. g. meredithae ( usa and unknown sources ) in group b was closely related to g. lucidum in group a as evidenced by a high bootstrap value of 98%. the findings of the current study are consistent with those of park et al. who reported that g. lucidum strains from europe and north america could be clustered into one group together with g. tsugae based on both analyses of the its rdna gene and partial tubulin gene sequences.
