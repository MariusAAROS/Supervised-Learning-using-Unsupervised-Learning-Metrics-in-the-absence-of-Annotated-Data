alignment of the 329amino acid ha protein from 26 isolates obtained from this outbreak with the 2004/05 a / wyoming/3/03 vaccine strain and previous h3n2 vaccine strains indicated 4 evident amino acid changes present in most of the isolates ( table 2 ). alignment of the 329amino acid ha protein from 26 isolates obtained from this outbreak with the 2004/05 a / wyoming/3/03 vaccine strain and previous h3n2 vaccine strains indicated 4 evident amino acid changes present in most of the isolates ( table 2 ). the 3dimensional depiction provides a unique regional residue perspective , demonstrating how the rapidly evolving ha surface antigens in the vaccine strain differ at the molecular level. located above the receptor binding pocket is a serine to asparagine change ( shown in green ) that possibly alters the regional surface topography at position 189 within antibody binding site b. located above the receptor binding pocket is a serine to asparagine change ( shown in green ) that possibly alters the regional surface topography at position 189 within antibody binding site b. three amino acid changes are confined within known antibody binding sites , i.e. , the s189n change within antibody binding site b ( 4,5 ) and the v226i and s227p changes residing in antibody binding site d ( 4,5 ). this substitution resides within antibody binding site d , which corresponds to residues 225228 , which make up the left side of the receptor binding pocket ( 14 ).
