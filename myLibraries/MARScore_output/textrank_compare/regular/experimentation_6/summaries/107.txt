thirty adult hiv seropositive women with symptoms suggestive of rtis ( study group a1 ) , thirty adult hiv seropositive women without symptoms suggestive of rtis ( study group a2 ) , thirty age and sex matched adult hiv seronegative women with symptoms suggestive of rtis ( control group b1 ) , thirty age and sex matched adult hiv seronegative women without symptoms suggestive of rtis ( control group b2 ). this compares well with the findings of another study done in baroda , india , to look for the prevalence of rtis in hiv infected women wherein the mean age for hiv positive women was 30 and that for hiv negative women was 27. the primary objective of this study was to establish the need for screening hiv seropositive women for cti. study subjects were recruited as follows : thirty adult hiv seropositive women with symptoms suggestive of rtis ( study group a1),thirty adult hiv seropositive women without symptoms suggestive of rtis ( study group a2),thirty age and sex matched adult hiv seronegative women with symptoms suggestive of rtis ( control group b1),thirty age and sex matched adult hiv seronegative women without symptoms suggestive of rtis ( control group b2 ). the prevalence of cti was higher in hiv seropositive women as compared to hiv seronegative women ( or 4.214 ; 95% ci 0.45738.865 ) and among the hiv positive asymptomatic as compared to the hiv negative asymptomatic ( or 2.111 ; 95% ci 1.6062.776 ) , although the differences were not found to be statistically significant ( table 6 ). genital infection due to chlamydia trachomatis is one of the most prevalent bacterial sexually transmitted infections ( stis ). according to the who estimates , globally 92 million new cases of c. trachomatis infection.
