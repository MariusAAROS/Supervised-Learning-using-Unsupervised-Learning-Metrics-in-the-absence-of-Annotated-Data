it is irrational to utilize mdct alone to assess lv function in clinical patients , given the radiation exposure involved. the ecg dependent tube current modulation is currently the most effective tool for dose reduction and may reduce patient dose by up to 50%. quantitative values of ventricular volumes and of myocardial mass are independent predictors of morbidity and mortality in patients with coronary artery disease. is considered the clinical gold standard for lv function assessment , but it is expensive , of limited availability , and can not be performed in patients with implanted pacemakers or defibrillators. however , a small number of patients may need a retrospective gating , thus providing possibility of reconstructions in various phases of cardiac activity. patients with absolute contraindication to contrast or radiation were excluded from the study. in patients with relative contraindications such as atopy , asthma , and renal failure scan was performed if the benefit of examination outweighed the risk in such patients.
