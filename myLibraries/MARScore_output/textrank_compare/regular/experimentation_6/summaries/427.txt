generating mutation summary metrics in study subjects determination of recurrent mutations by frequency determination of phenotype specific mutations by association test graphical illustration of user selected mutations generating mutation summary metrics in study subjects determination of recurrent mutations by frequency determination of phenotype specific mutations by association test graphical illustration of user selected mutations. in this study , in order to support the definition of recurrent mutations or phenotype specific mutations from ngs data of a group of cancers with diverse phenotypes , we aimed to develop a user friendly tool , named mutation arranger for defining phenotype related snv ( map ). phenotype specific mutations that occur more frequently in one of two clinical conditions ( e.g. , drug responder vs. non responder ) are determined by chi square test under the user defined significance level. in colorectal cancers , although the majority of recurrent mutations have been previously known , some novel mutations , such as the mutations in the sox9 and fam123b genes , were also identified by ngs technology , which may have implications for colorectal tumorigenesis. then , map software represents the user selected mutations graphically in the ' visualization ' tab. it is widely accepted that mutation is the main causal factor for diverse tumorigenesis [ 1 , 2 ]. the recent development of next generation sequencing ( ngs ) technologies has revolutionized the speed and throughput of dna sequencing , which facilitates the discovery of new driver mutations.
