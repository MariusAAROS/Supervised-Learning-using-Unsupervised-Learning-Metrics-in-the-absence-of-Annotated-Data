several previous studies have compared the diagnostic accuracy of unprocessed digital images ( psp and charge coupled device or ccd ) , film based radiographs and inverted images for detection of peri implant bone defects and simulated periodontal lesions using image tool and adobe photoshop software programs [ 1214 ]. similar results were obtained indicating the higher diagnostic accuracy of unprocessed digital images and film based radiographs than inverted images. based on the results , we found that unprocessed digital images had higher diagnostic accuracy than inverted images for detection of small and large peri implant defects. the sensitivity and specificity of unprocessed images were higher than those of inverted digital images. however , our results regarding the lower accuracy of inverted digital images compared to unprocessed images were similar to those of kavadella et al. molon et al , in their study compared the diagnostic accuracy of unprocessed and converted ( cmos sensor ) images with film based conventional radiographs for detection of bone loss due to simulated periodontal disease. based on the results , unprocessed images had a higher diagnostic value than inverted images. considering the equality of variances , the t test showed that unprocessed images had higher absolute negative predictive value ( p=0.049 ) and complete negative predictive value ( p=0.017 ) than inverted images ( table 1 ).
