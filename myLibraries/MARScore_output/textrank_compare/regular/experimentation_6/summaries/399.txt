point of care viral load assays for hepatitis b and c have the potential to bridge this gap and prove valuable tools for expansion of treatment globally.. management of viral hepatitis is going through a revolution with the launch of new direct acting antivirals for hepatitis c treatment. the international nongovernmental organization mdecins sans frontires published their desired specifications for a point of care hiv viral load assay a few years ago , and the same specification would also apply to an ideal hbv or hcv assay : no need for specialized laboratory facilities closed system to avoid contamination long shelf life in tropical climate no need for cold chain transportation or refrigerated storage affordability is an important issue if treatment for viral hepatitis is to be scaled up globally. the uk biotechnology company epistem received a prestigious grant award in 2013 to develop an hcv point of care device for viral load testing and genotyping. with regard to hbv , repeated tests over time are usually required , and the accumulated cost of viral load testing can be high. despite the huge burden of hepatitis b worldwide , with an estimated 350 million people chronically infected , very few patients in low and middle income countries are currently receiving antiviral treatment. this is largely to blame on lack of access to viral load quantification , because this is considered a mandatory component of the diagnostic work up in all international liver society guidelines.
