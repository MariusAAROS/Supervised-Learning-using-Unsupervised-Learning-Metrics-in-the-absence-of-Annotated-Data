we observed hypotension in 13% patients in group m and 16% patient in group b. hypotention was managed by i.v fluids and vasopressors were needed for only 1% and 3% parturients in groups m and b , respectively which was comparable in both groups , suggesting that the clonidine groups did not have a higher predisposition for the development of hypotension if administered sequentially. mean time to reach maximal cephalad sensory block height was significantly less in group b ( 3.21 0.13 min ) than in group m ( 4.43 0.26 min ) and the total duration of analgesia lasted significantly longer in group b ( 474.3 20.79 min ) as compared to group m ( 337 18.22 min ) complete motor blockade was achieved earlier in group b ( 4.75 0.40 ) than in group m ( 5.84 0.36 ) the resolution time of motor block back to modified bromage i was significantly prolonged in group b ( 292.23 15.24 min ) than in group m ( 189.50 16.31 min ) [ table 2 ]. it was observed that only one patient in group m and 3 in group b had sedation score of 4 according to rss. the time to reach maximum sensory block height and maximum motor block was significantly less in group b ( sequential drugs ) than in group m ( mixed drugs ) in this study. in our study , we found that the mean time taken for sensory block to regress to t10 level was significantly longer in group b ( 240.67 18.47 min ) than in group m ( 153.83 13.11 min ).
