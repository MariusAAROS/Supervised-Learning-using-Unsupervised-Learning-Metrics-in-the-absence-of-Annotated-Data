since s327 is conserved among b subunit family members , it is likely that other b subunits are regulated similarly. the heterotrimeric holoenzyme is composed of a catalytic subunit ( c ) a scaffold subunit ( a ) and one member of four families of regulatory subunits ( b ) ( figure 1 ). the b family ( b55 , pr55 , ppp2r2 ) of regulatory subunits consists of four genes ( , , , ) , the b family ( b56 , pr61 , ppp2r5 ) is comprised of five isoforms ( , , , , ) , the b family ( pr72 , ppp2r3 ) includes three isoforms ( /pr72/130 , /pr59 , /pr48 ) , and the b family ( pr93/pr110 ) is made up of three proteins ( sg2na , striatin , and mmob1 ). this mechanism of targeting pp2a activity is highlighted by extensive studies of the b family of regulatory subunits. specifically , b and b are primarily cytosolic where as the bregulatory subunit associates with a detergent resistant protein fraction consistent with an interaction at the cytoskeleton.. similar diversity has been observed in the b family of regulatory subunits. studies wherein pp2a / b is isolated from intact cells have revealed that methylation of the c subunit at l309 is required for incorporation of the b family of regulatory subunits into the holoenzyme complex [ 39 , 40 , 42 , 44 , 54 , 55 ]. conversely , in vitro assembly of the pp2a / b holoenzyme complex does not require methylation of the c subunit for incorporation of the b family of regulatory subunits [ 56 , 57 ].
