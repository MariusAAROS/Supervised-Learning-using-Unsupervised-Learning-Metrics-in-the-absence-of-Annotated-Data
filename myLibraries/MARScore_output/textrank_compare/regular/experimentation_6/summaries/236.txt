x ray contrast agents,(12 ) and slow release agents for drug delivery.(13 ) recently , c60based reagents have also been examined as dna transfection vectors and tested for the ability to mediate gene transfer. transfection as described herein also relates to cell viability for sufficient time to ensure gfp gene expression , which was determined by cell fluorescence levels above a defined background threshold level ( determined using nontransfected cells to set lower detection limit parameter ) with flow cytometry. this assay was preferred over the 3(4,5dimethylthiazol2yl)2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide ( mtt ) assay for evaluation of cell viability because c60vectors compounds i and ii interacted and attached to the mtt formazan making the formazan crystals insoluble for the next colorimetric assay. lowest overall cell viability was observed with compound i ( 0.55 0.08 ) at 10 g/l , and no statistically significant increase in cell viability was observed with decreasing compound i concentration. at the 8 h c60 incubation time , the fraction of live cells was higher than 50% for all c60 solutions tested except those exposed to compound i. for compound i , the cell viability was the lowest ( 0.51 0.04 ) at 10 g/l , but no statistically significant increase in cell viability was observed with decreasing compound i concentration. and iv exhibited greater than 50% cell viability at all concentrations tested , with an increase in cell viability with decreased c60 compound ( iii and iv ) concentration. all other compounds showed a general trend of increased viability with a decrease in compound concentration , with cell viability values lower than 50% at 10 g/l. figures 3 a , b and c display the cell viability of nih 3t3 cells cultured in the presence of the various c60vector / dna mixtures as a function of both c60 compound concentration and r values after 2 , 8 or 24 h post transfection time , respectively.
