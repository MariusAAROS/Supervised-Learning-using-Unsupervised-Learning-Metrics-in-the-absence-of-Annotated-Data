given this , could a diachronic understanding of what it is to have mental capacity help by justifying the inclusion of a requirement such as the ability to consider the future as a part of what it means to be able to understand , retain , use or weigh information in assessments of mental capacity ?. influential liberal thinking holds that it is not the place of the law to pursue certain ends rather , the law should aim to provide a space for individuals to pursue their own ends ( plant , 2011 ) and this position is reflected in english common law relating to mental capacity:[in assessments of capacity ] it is most important that those considering the issue should not confuse the question of mental capacity with the nature of the decision made by the patient , however grave the consequences. [ in assessments of capacity ] it is most important that those considering the issue should not confuse the question of mental capacity with the nature of the decision made by the patient , however grave the consequences. in practice then , questions of mental capacity might be thought of as boiling down to a question about whether a decision can be explained in terms of the patient 's particular motivating commitments ( their desires , values , projects , ideas about a good life ) ; or whether the decision is properly explained in terms of a problem in decision making , which is due to a dysfunction of mind or brain. as a result , if this understanding of commitments is adopted in assessments of mental capacity the reach of this area of law arguably does not extend as far as it should a person may be judged to have mental capacity where this seems doubtful. psychopathologies characterised by this kind of problem seem better accounted for in a legal structure that conceives of mental capacity , and in particular , commitments , in diachronic terms. ( 2011 , p. 33. ; for a full description of the case , see halpern , 2012)differences between these cases suggest that taking a diachronic perspective in assessments of mental capacity allows for decision making to be compromised in at least two ways.
