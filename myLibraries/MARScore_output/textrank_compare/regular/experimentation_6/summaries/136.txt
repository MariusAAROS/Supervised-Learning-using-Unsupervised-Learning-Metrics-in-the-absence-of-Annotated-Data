, we further tested whether there was evidence of an interaction effect between vitamin d status and sex and vitamin d status and obesity. , we further tested whether there was evidence of an interaction effect between vitamin d status and sex and vitamin d status and obesity. vitamin d status is known to be lower in the elderly compared with the young as the subcutaneous synthesis of vitamin d decreases with increasing age , due to a reduced concentration of 7dehydrocholesterol in the skin ( 1 ) and reduced absorption of oral vitamin d ( 8). vitamin d deficiency showed a much weaker or for type 2 diabetes previously diagnosed , as could perhaps have been anticipated , given the vigorous clinical management of the disease and the longer time interval between disease development and the assessment of vitamin d status. furthermore , sufficient serum for determination of vitamin d status was not available from 44 subjects ; thus , 668 subjects are included in the current study. vitamin d status was used as a binary exposure variable , i.e. , dichotomized at above ( sufficient ) or below 50 nmol / l ( deficient ) , and in the simple model , sex was used as an obligate covariate. in addition , we examined the association between vitamin d status and risk of having 1 ) newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes or 2 ) a known diagnosis of type 2 diabetes using the same models separately.
