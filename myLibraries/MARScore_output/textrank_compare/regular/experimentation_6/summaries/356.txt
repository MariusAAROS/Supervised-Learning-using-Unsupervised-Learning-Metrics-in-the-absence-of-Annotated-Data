over the next several minutes , ventricular fibrillation developed ; despite aggressive treatment , including defibrillation , epinephrine , and direct manual cardiac massage , adequate circulation could not be restored , and cardiac massage was continued. , direct cardiac massage may not be aggressively and effectively performed due to the fear of disrupting the previously grafted conduits , limiting the drug delivery from the venous side to the systemic circulation. however , direct injection to the aortic root following a sternotomy appears to be feasible and may be life saving , as severe right ventricular dysfunction may limit systemic drug delivery injected through the venous side despite the performance of direct cardiac massage. in conclusion , in the rare case of a gas embolism occurring during opcab occurs , the potential for catastrophic results necessitates immediate and appropriate managements including supportive measures , needle aspiration of gas , and cpr with direct cardiac massage. subsequently , manual cardiac massage was continued for several cycles , and spontaneous recovery of unspecified cardiac rhythm was observed. he had a left ventricular ejection fraction of 42% and regional wall motion abnormalities compatible with multi vessel territories. coronary angiography findings revealed total occlusion at the proximal left anterior descending artery ( lad ) , 50 75% stenosis at the mid to distal left circumflex artery , and 90% stenosis at the mid right coronary artery ( rca ).
