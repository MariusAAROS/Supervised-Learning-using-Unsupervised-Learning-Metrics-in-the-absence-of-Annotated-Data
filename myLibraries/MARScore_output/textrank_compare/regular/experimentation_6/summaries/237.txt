data in figure 5 ( left ) demonstrate that sensory nerve conduction velocity was significantly decreased in high fat fed c57bl/6j mice compared to control mice and that this was prevented by treating high fat fed mice with ilepatril or candoxatril using a prevention protocol. when calculating the epididymal fat pad mass as a percent of total body weight epididymal fat pad mass was significantly increased in high fat fed c57bl/6j mice and mice fed a high fat diet containing candoxatril compared to control. treatment with ilepatril or candoxatril and to a lesser extent enalapril for the 12week period prevented thermal hypoalgesia in high fat fed c57bl/6j mice. data in figure 5 ( right ) demonstrate that the number of intraepidermal nerve fiber profiles was significantly decreased in high fat fed c57bl/6j mice and that treatment of these mice with ilepatril or candoxatril but not enalapril for 12 weeks prevented the significant decrease. the decrease in thermal nociception in high fat fed c57bl/6j mice was reversed by treating mice with ilepatril or candoxatril but not enalapril ( figure 7 , center ). treating high fat fed c57bl/6j mice with ilepatril , candoxatril , or enalapril reversed the decrease in intraepidermal nerve fiber profiles ( figure 7 , right ). afterwards , the four groups of high fat fed mice were fed a high fat diet with no additions ( group 2 ) or high fat diet containing ilepatril , candoxatril , or enalapril ( groups 35 ) for 12 weeks.
