a definitive diagnosis of flexor tendon contracture was made ( figure 6 ). these factors could elicit an abnormal inflammatory response and result in flexor fibrosis , adhesion formation and evolution toward flexor tendon contracture. this case series reports three different clinical presentations of digital flexor tendon contracture in three cats , all successfully treated by tenectomy. this case series is of particular interest because it describes three different presentations of digital flexor tendon contracture in cats. however , such an important delay , as seen in this case , between onychectomy and the development of digital flexor tendon contracture has not been previously reported. thus , digital flexor tendon contracture can not be ruled out because of an increased delay from the onychectomy. in case 1 , which involved an onychectomized cat , tendon contracture involved only one digit , which is different from the two cases reported by cooper et al.
