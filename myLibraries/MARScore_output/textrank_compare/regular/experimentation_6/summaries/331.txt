compared patients treated with gkrs targeted at the dorsal root entry zone ( 59 patients ) with patients whose radiosurgical target was the retrogasserian zone of the trigeminal nerve ( 41 patients ). patients diagnosed with symptomatic tn experience trigeminal related facial pain secondary to a brain tumor , skull deformity , or multiple sclerosis ( ms ). evidence suggests that the majority of cases of tn are the consequence of focal compression of the entry zone of the root of the trigeminal nerve , while only 2% of cases are observed in patients diagnosed with ms. other than excruciating facial pain , there are no other direct medical symptoms associated with tn , and the condition does not decrease life expectancy. although the neurosurgical modalities are preferred in many clinical situations and have proven to be effective in achieving initial pain control , they are known to come with a variety of complications , and facial pain recurrence is likely.. stereotactic radiosurgery ( srs ) has proven to be an effective management approach for patients with medically and surgically refractory tn as a primary and repeat treatment modality. since the time of leksell , advancements in radiosurgery and imaging technologies has led to the increasing popularity of srs as a treatment option for patients with tn. as the evidence examining the role of gkrs in the management of patients with tn is increasing ,. the goal of this paper is to provide a modern review of the literature thoroughly analyzing the efficacy of gkrs in the treatment of patients with tn , as well as evaluating the treatment planning and methods associated with this evolving modality.
