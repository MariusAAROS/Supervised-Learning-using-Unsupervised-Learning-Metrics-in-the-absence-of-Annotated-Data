adverse effects of mtx are , usually , mild and self limiting , but may include serious adverse drug reactions such as hematopoietic suppression , pulmonary , and hepatotoxicity. patients taking mtx are more likely to discontinue therapy because of adverse drug effects rather than because of lack of efficacy. clinicians must collaborate with the pharmacovigilance center to detect and notify serious adverse effects of mtx. it is one of the most commonly used medicines in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis or psoriatic arthritis. we report the case of an adult woman with psoriatic arthritis who developed acute severe hepatitis following long term treatment with mtx. the periodic biological monitoring of liver enzymes : alanine aminotransferase ( alat ) , aspartate aminotransferase ( asat ) , gamma glutamyl transpeptidase ( gamma gt ) performed every 6 months did not reveal any abnormalities. mtx was stopped in the year 2005 due to remission of the disease.
