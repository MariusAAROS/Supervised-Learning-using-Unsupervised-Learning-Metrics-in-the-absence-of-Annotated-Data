the expression vector peyfp c1 containing cattle xlf ( peyfp cattle xlf ) was transfected into mdbk cells ( fig. , we clarified that eyfp cattle xlf was localized in the nuclei of living interphase cells in eyfp cattle xlf transfectants ( fig. 2c ). expression and localization of cattle xlf in cattle cells : we examined the expression and subcellular localization of xlf in cattle cells. these observations indicate that the localization of cattle xlf changes dynamically during the cell cycle. next , we investigated whether cattle xlf accumulated at 405 nm laser induced dsb sites by immunostaining with an antibody that detects h2ax. the c terminal region ( ctr ) of cattle xlf is essential for the nuclear localization and recruitment of xlf to dsbs in cattle cells : to determine the region essential for nuclear localization of cattle xlf , we investigated the localization of cattle xlf and its mutant. 4.the c terminal region ( ctr ) is vital for the nuclear localization and recruitment of cattle xlf to dsbs in vivo.
