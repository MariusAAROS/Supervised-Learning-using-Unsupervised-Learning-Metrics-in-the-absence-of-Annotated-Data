there may be a great degree of overlap in the clinical and laboratory manifestations between anca associated vasculitis and anca positive infected aortic aneurysm , potentially leading to a misdiagnosis. to our knowledge , this is the first report of an infected aortic aneurysm with a positive pr3anca test and clinical features mimicking anca associated vasculitis. however , to our knowledge , infected aortic aneurysms have not been reported to show positive findings on anca tests. anti neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies ( ancas ) correlate well with a wide spectrum of vasculitis manifestations , including wegener 's granulomatosis , microscopic polyangiitis , and churg strauss syndrome , all of which are commonly referred to as anca associated vasculitis ( 1 ). several infections , particularly infective endocarditis , have been reported to show positive findings on anca tests ; furthermore , their clinical features have been acknowledged to mimic anca associated vasculitis , which may lead to a misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment ( 2,3 ). alt : alanine aminotransferase , ana : antinuclear antibodies , ast : aspartate transaminase , c3 : compliment 3 , c4 : compliment 4 , ch50 : 50% hemolytic unit of complement , crp : c reactive protein , dna : deoxyribonucleic acid , ldh : lactate dehydrogenase , mpo anca : myeloperoxidase antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody , rf : rheumatic factor , pr3anca : anti proteinase 3antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody she was initially diagnosed with pr3anca associated vasculitis and was thereafter treated with methylprednisolone pulse therapy ( 500 mg / day ) for three days ( fig. associated vasculitis.
