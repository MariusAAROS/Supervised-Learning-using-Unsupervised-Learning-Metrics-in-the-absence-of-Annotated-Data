the small bowel in ileus might be fragile , gangrenous or necrotic and there is probably a higher risk of bowel perforation performing a laparoscopic approach. we do not routinely use verres needle in laparoscopy , we prefer to use visiport as an optical trocar or an open hasson approach that is another safe alternative to minimize the chance of bowel perforation on entrance into the abdominal cavity. in 2012 , 4 years later , she was admitted to hospital with a 2 days history of severe abdominal pain , vomiting and the inability to pass gas or stools for the last few days. this patient had to undergo several surgical procedures to re establish blood flow to the extremity because of trombosis of the iliac artery. she underwent laparotomy with total abdominal hysterectomy , omentectomy , appendectomy , with a radical retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy which involved en bloc dissection and removal of the para aortic and iliac lymphe nodes. para aortic and pelvic lymphadenectomy is often performed in the treatment of ovarian or testicular cancer. internal herniation of a small bowel behind the external iliac artery after lymphadenectomy is a very rare complication to this procedure and to our knowledge only reported twice in the literature.
