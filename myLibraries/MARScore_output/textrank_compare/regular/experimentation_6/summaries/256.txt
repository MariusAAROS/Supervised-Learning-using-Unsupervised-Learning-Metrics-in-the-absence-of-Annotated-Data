his fasting and stimulated c peptide levels were 1.4 pmol / ml and 2.5 pmol / ml with negative gad antibody test ( 4.1 iu / ml ). his fasting and stimulated c peptide levels were 1.4 pmol / ml and 2.5 pmol / ml with negative gad antibody test ( 4.1 iu / ml ). his fasting and stimulated c peptide levels were 1.4 pmol / ml and 2.5 pmol / ml with negative gad antibody test ( 4.1 iu / ml ). we present two cases of type 2 dm with ds and believe that this is the first report of type dm with ds. impaired cell function and insulin sensitivity are the main factors in the pathogenesis of type 2 dm. cell function was fairly preserved in these two patients ( as indicated by c peptide levels in the blood ) with negative antibody testing for gad ab. physical examination revealed typical mongolian facies and other features of ds such as short stature ( 145 cm ) , brachycephaly , short neck and pot belly , small mouth with protruding tongue , wide occipital region and characteristic small eyes of ds. laboratory data revealed diabetes with fasting plasma glucose of 256 mg / dl , postprandial plasma glucose of 375 mg / dl and glycated hemoglobin ( hba1c ) level of 9.9%. physical examination revealed typical mongolian facies and other features of ds such as short stature ( 145 cm ) , brachycephaly , short neck and pot belly , small mouth with protruding tongue , wide occipital region and characteristic small eyes of ds. laboratory data revealed diabetes with fasting plasma glucose of 256 mg / dl , postprandial plasma glucose of 375 mg / dl and glycated hemoglobin ( hba1c ) level of 9.9%.
