our experiments and calculations thus demonstrate that excitation and excited state decay involve two different electronic states. state without any structural constrains associated with the homo1 lumo excitation leads to a stable minimum that can be reached from the franck condon excited geometry by relatively small structural changes ( supplementary figure 4 ) , and an excited state ir absorption spectrum that is in good agreement with the sas of species 1 ( figure 2 ). despite the large number of theoretical and experimental studies that have focused on characterizing this process , there are several key questions outstanding including identification of the main structural coordinates and the role of various electronic states involved in the excited state dynamics.. time resolved studies are essential to elucidate these dynamics but have thus far focused on probing the change in the electronic structure after photoexcitation through uv / vis absorption and fluorescence studies. condon excited bright state ( supplementary figure 3 ) , this suggests that motion along the c = c stretch coordinate needs to be taken into account as well for understanding the decay of the fluorescence. one of the key challenges in the development of novel materials is the ability to tune and control their macroscopic physical and chemical properties on a molecular level by external stimuli. such a degree of control is challenging but crucial for a wide range of applications ranging from catalysis to pharmacological and medical applications. in photoactive materials light absorbed by chromophores can be converted into directed functionality , typically by means of photoinduced isomerization of nitrogen or carbon containing double bonds and pericylic reactions.
