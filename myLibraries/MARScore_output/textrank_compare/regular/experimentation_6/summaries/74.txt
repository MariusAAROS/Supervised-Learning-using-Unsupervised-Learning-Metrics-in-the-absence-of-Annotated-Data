we also demonstrate an excess transmission of mutant allele g at retn420 from 130 trio families using tdt analysis. for the first time , the presented data suggest that a variant in the retn gene plays a significant role in acne pathogenesis. therefore , we suggest that inherited variation in retn at 420 appears to be associated with heritable acne vulgaris.
