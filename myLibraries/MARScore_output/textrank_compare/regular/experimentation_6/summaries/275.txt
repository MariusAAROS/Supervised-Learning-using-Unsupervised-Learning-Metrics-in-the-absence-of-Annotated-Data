the overall incidence of unexpected difficult intubation is estimated to be 1%3% , while failed intubation incidence is 0.05%0.35% in europe.1 difficult endotracheal intubation has been described in patients with pituitary diseases like acromegaly , cushing s disease , lh / follicle stimulating hormone secreting adenoma , thyroid stimulating hormone secreting adenoma , nonfunctional adenoma and prolactinoma.4 difficult airway with dwarfism has also been described. the rate of difficult intubation has been found to be higher in osas patients than the normal , healthy population.7 body mass index , mallampati grading , cormack lehane classification , sternomental distance , and thyromental distance evaluation might be predictive factors for difficult airway in osas patients. thus , anesthesiologists must take into account difficult airway in endocrinological disorders like hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and be prepared for difficult intubation. he had not had any prior operation under general anesthesia , so he did not have any history of difficult intubation , and he did not have any chronic systemic disease. as such , anesthesiologists must be aware of this fact and be prepared for difficult intubation in osas patients.7 however , the rate of difficult intubation has not been found to be related to the severity of osas.8 no significant relationship between the apnea hypopnea index and difficult intubation has been found.8 in our patient , no apnea and daytime sleepiness were present in his history. there may be an unrevealed relationship between hypogonadism and difficult airway. however , difficult airway with a hypogonadotropic patient has not yet been clearly defined.
