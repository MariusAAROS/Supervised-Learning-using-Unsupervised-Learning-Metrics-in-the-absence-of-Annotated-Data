validation of phototoxicity ratios in correction of toxicity tests endpoint values was performed on data obtained in absence of sunlight or ssr.. phototoxicity data summarized in table 1 ( obtained in the presence of sunlight or ssr ) , served as a control group. therefore , although uv insolation levels currently used in nanotio2 phototoxicity studies are credible at the water surface level , it is still not clear whether they are credible for risk assessment below the water surface. phototoxicity data and data obtained in the absence of sunlight or ssr ( figure 2 ). uva = ultraviolet a ; uvb = ultraviolet b ; pr = phototoxicity ratio ; noec = noobservedeffect concentration ; na = data are not available. on the other hand , the spearman rank correlation test was not statistically significant for phylogeny and phototoxicity ratio ( decreased or increased phototoxicity of nanotio2 from species on the lower organism stadium , such as bacteria , toward more complex organisms , such as amphibians ). also , there was no correlation between phototoxicity ratio and irradiation intensity , duration of irradiation , or received insolation. descriptive statistics of phototoxicity ratio ( pr ) values significant statistical difference was observed between true.
