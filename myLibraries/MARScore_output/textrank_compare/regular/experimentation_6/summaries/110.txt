a young man was referred with a chief complaint of blurred vision and pain of the left eye 1 month after herpetic encephalitis in the left frontotemporal lobe. herpetic encephalitis may be a risk factor for acute retinal necrosis. the patient had no past medical history indicating an immunocompromised state ; he had been admitted to the neurology ward due to herpetic encephalitis 1 month previous to the occurrence of visual symptoms. some of the studies report arn several years after neonatal and infantile herpetic encephalitis [ 5 , 6 ] ; therefore , herpetic encephalitis may be a risk factor for arn development. these reports may necessitate a prophylaxis with antiviral agents after herpetic encephalitis to prevent arn. in a study by pavsio et al. , the role of long term prophylaxis with acyclovir in children who had herpetic encephalitis is an important issue. on the other hand , arn may be an indication of possible central nervous system involvement and neuroimaging may be necessary in all cases of arn to rule out herpetic encephalitis.
