the use of ramelteon , a kind of mt1 and mt2 agonist , could also relieve the pain even lack of free radical scavenger effects.3 ) the state of art treatment of refractory chronic migraine also includes the ramelteon due to selective m1 receptor agonism.6 ) from the successful experience in this case , we can consider the use of ramelteon for refractory chronic migraine with insomnia. the melatonin might relieve the headache via the following possible mechanisms , such as anti inflammatory effect , free radical scavenging , reduction of pro inflammatory cytokine , membrane stabilization , nitric oxide synthase activity and dopamine release inhibition , gaba and opioid analgesia potentitation , glutamate neurotoxicity protection , neurovascular regulation,2 ) cytoprotection and antiallodynic action.3 ) the pineal gland , the primary source of serotonin and melatonin , might also play a significant role in the analgesic effect.4 ) the residual symptom between the migraine episodes were the head tense feeling , but not achieveing headache severity. therefore we could speculate that the ramelteon had significant effects in migraine in such mild prolongation of sleep duration. the selective melatonin receptor agonism effect of ramelteon is useful for insomnia.1 ) here we wanted to present a refractory chronic migraine case , who had significant improvements in migraine after using ramelteon. the precipitating factors were the stress , increase in physical activities and sudden cold weather. the moderate or severe pain intensity was aggravated by or causing avoidance of increased physical activity.
