, there is a necessity to be able to identify hereditary renal cell cancer families with a minimum set of criteria that will provide a high likelihood of ascertainment. the first is the difficulty in fulfilling criteria in countries where large families and extensive pedigrees are impossible to identify , for whatever reason , even though the incidence of hereditary renal cell cancer may be quite high. to date there are 19 hereditary syndromes described in which renal cell cancer may occur ( table 1 ). genetic syndromes characterised by an increased risk of renal cancer ( familial cancer database facd , http://facd.uicc.org ) the identification of genetic predispositions to renal cell cancer remains a priority since knowledge about the underlying molecular genetic basis of the disease will allow for a better understanding of the mechanisms giving rise to the disease and , perhaps more importantly , allow for the identification of individuals who are at risk of disease development. second , the criteria do not take into consideration the existence of family cancer syndromes where renal cell cancer may occur in association with an extra gastric malignancy. group a1 ( nuclear pedigree ) : comprising 25 patients affected by ccrc from group a. none of the parents of these patients have been diagnosed as affected with renal cell cancer. there are two aspects of these criteria that can be problematic in the clinical setting with respect to the identification of familial renal cell cancer patients.
