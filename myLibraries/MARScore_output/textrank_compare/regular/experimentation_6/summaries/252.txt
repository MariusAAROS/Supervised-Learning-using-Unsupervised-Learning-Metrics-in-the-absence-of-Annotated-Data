dissatisfied with our own 33% negative laparotomy rate , prospective evaluation of the role of diagnostic laparoscopy in the evaluation of suspected penetrating abdominal injury was undertaken in september 1995 to identify those patients who could safely avoid surgical intervention , with the expectation that the rate of negative trauma celiotomy would markedly decrease. in patients with thoracoabdominal injuries and suspected diaphragmatic tears , a low pressure pneumoperitoneum of 8 10 mm hg was created , the diaphragms visualized , and if no diaphragmatic injuries were present , the pneumoperitoneum was raised to 15 mm hg. routine thoracostomy tubes were not placed prophylactically in light of zargut 's reported 1% pneumothorax rate following carbon dioxide insufflation ( 5 of 510 patients ) ; rather , the anesthesia and surgical teams were alerted to the possible development of a tension pneumothorax in patients at risk for diaphragmatic injury. laparoscopy has been championed by some authors as a routine maneuver in the evaluation of penetrating lower chest injuries to detect clinically and radiologically occult diaphragmatic injuries. the applications of thoracoscopy in the trauma patient are expanding ; this technique can be used to detect and repair diaphragmatic injuries , evaluate the pericardium , and treat both ongoing and established hemothoraces. while other authors have demonstrated its sensitivity in the detection of diaphragmatic injuries , we urge caution in its use as the primary diagnostic study in penetrating thoracoabdominal trauma based on our experience with missed major intrathoracic injuries , and are currently investigating the complementary role of thoracoscopy in penetrating lower thoracic injuries. however , two of the remaining ten patients with thoracoabdominal stab wounds who underwent negative diagnostic laparoscopy manifested ongoing thoracic blood loss that necessitated return to the operating room , reinduction of general anesthesia and thoracotomy for definitive control of pulmonary parenchymal bleeding. thus , in patients with penetrating thoracoabdominal trauma and negative diagnostic laparoscopy , we now believe that diagnostic thoracoscopy should be performed before the patient leaves the operating room.
