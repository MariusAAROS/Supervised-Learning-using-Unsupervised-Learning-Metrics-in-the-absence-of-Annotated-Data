leaf senescence is the last phase of plant development and a highly coordinated process regulated by a large number of senescence associated genes ( sags ) ( 12 ). leaf senescence can either be naturally induced during development stages , or stimulated by environmental factors including darkness , nutritional deficiency and various stresses ( 13 ). many advances in the understanding of leaf senescence at the molecular level had been achieved through the identification and characterization of hundreds of sags and senescence related mutants in arabidopsis thaliana , lycopersicon esculentum and nicotiana tabaccum ( 14 ). microarray expression profiling in arabidopsis revealed that more than 800 genes are up regulated during the course of leaf senescence ( 5 ). among them , more than 200 transcription factors , including wrky , nac , mads , myb , bzip and bhlh family members , are involved in the regulation of leaf senescence , indicating that leaf senescence is governed by complex transcriptional regulatory networks. molecular and genetic studies of leaf senescence in recent years led to the accumulation of a large volume of scattered information related to sags. the construction of a leaf senescence related database with wide spread collection and systematic annotation of sags may provide a useful resource and a good starting point for the further study of the molecular aspects of leaf senescence.
