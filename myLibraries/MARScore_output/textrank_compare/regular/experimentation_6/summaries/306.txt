the mean onset time of lignocaine anesthesia was 1.337 0.2369 , whereas in articaine group the mean time was 1.012 0.2058 min. this indicates that onset time of articaine was significantly less than lidocaine ( p < 0.0005 ) ( table 2 ). duration of anesthesia is articaine group is more than the lignocaine group. recent studies have shown that articaine carries lot of advantages over other anesthetic agents.4 in this study , we observed that the palatal infiltration was required in approximately 98% of cases when lignocaine was used , whereas in articaine group palatal anesthesia was never required. experimental sites ( group 1 ) were injected with 0.5 1 ml of 4% articaine hcl containing 1:100000 adrenaline , incrementally in the buccal vestibule. on the other hand , control sites ( group 2 ) were injected with 0.8 1 ml of 2% lignocaine hcl containing 1:100000 adrenaline , incrementally in the buccal vestibule. duration of pain in group 1 was 69.08 18.247 and 55.66 6.414 in group 2 patients. local anesthesia is being used since long.
