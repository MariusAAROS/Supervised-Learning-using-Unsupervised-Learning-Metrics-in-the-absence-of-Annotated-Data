the objective of this study was to determine the effects of explanatory variables on the survival of cervical cancer patients using parametric regression model. the risks of death for cervical cancer patients were estimated by finding the regression coefficient ( j ) j=j , and the hazard ratio ( j ) j = exp(j ) where j = 1,2 denotes the stratum. multivariate analysis through forward selection method found that the most feasible model to describe the survival of cervical cancer patients was dependent upon the covariates namely , stage and metastasis. after applying the stratified model , this study found that the prognosis of cervical cancer patients was dependent upon the stage at diagnosis. these findings provide useful knowledge on the understanding of the survival of cervical cancer patients. ( 16 ) , indicating that patients with advanced stage of disease had a 54% higher risk of progression or death at any time than earlier stage patients. cervical cancer is the third most common cancer after breast and colorectal cancer and the fourth leading cause of death among women in malaysia(1 3 ).
