, we report an unusual case of renal malakoplakia involving the perirenal space and extending to the descending colon in a 65year old korean woman with secondary adrenal insufficiency and diabetes mellitus. , renal malakoplakia should be taken into account in the differential diagnosis of a patient who presents with urinary tract infection , fever , abdominal pain , and abscess like lesion in ultrasonography or ct , especially if the patient concerned has diabetes mellitus and a long history of use of exogenous steroids. although we did not carry out a detailed investigation of the patient 's immunity , we believe that unilateral renal malakoplakia extending to the perirenal space and the descending colon , as observed in the present case , may result from an interaction between various factors such as bacterial infection , impaired host immune response and diminished leukocyte function under the influence of a systemic illness such as secondary adrenal insufficiency and diabetes mellitus. the common presenting features of malakoplakia of the kidney are high fever , loin tenderness , and a palpable mass with a history of urinary tract infection.8 ) based on the reported studies , the degree of decreased kidney function varies up to acute renal failure.12,13 ) ultrasound and ct features are variable and only briefly mentioned in many reviews. mmol / l ( 24 30 ) , low serum osmolality 240.0 mosm ( 289.0 308.0 ) , and normal urine osmolality 315.0 ( 50.0 1200 ). malakoplakia is a rare chronic inflammatory disease that occurs most commonly in the genitourinary tract , especially the urinary bladder. most patients have associated conditions characterized by some degree of immunosuppression , as seen in solid organ transplants , autoimmune diseases requiring steroid use , chemotherapy , chronic systemic diseases , alcohol abuse and poorly controlled diabetes.1 )
