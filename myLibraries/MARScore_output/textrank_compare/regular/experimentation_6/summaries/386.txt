it is likely that combining this new modular device framework with upcoming advances in synthetic biology will strongly support the tailoring of rna based regulatory systems to diverse applications in various clinical and laboratory environments. the act strategy uses t cell based cytotoxic responses to attack malignant cells ( or any other types of abnormal cells ) that escape the body 's natural surveillance by using t cells that have a natural or genetically engineered reactivity to a patient 's cancer cells. t cells have first to be naturally or genetically engineered to react against a tumor specific antigen , then expanded and made more effective in vitro , and finally adoptively transferred into a cancer patient. in more detail , the authors fused a theophylline ribozyme switch to the 3 ' untranslated region of a tri functional transgene ( cd19tk t2a il15 ) encoding il15 ( potent survival / proliferative cytokine of t cells ) , mutant hsv1 thymidine kinase ( acting as a reporter and as a suicide protein in the presence of ganciclovir ) and cd19 ( a marker for fluorescence activated cell sorting and immunomagnetic selection ). , the failure of adoptive immunotherapy against cancers lies in the absence of tumor specific sources of t cells. , there have been breakthroughs in genetic engineering related to the inventory and methods necessary to physically construct and assemble biomolecular parts , such as synthetic rna based regulatory systems. a recent study by chen et al. has produced a significant advance in solving such issues and therefore potentially bridging the gap between the bench and the bedside for synthetic rna based regulatory systems.
