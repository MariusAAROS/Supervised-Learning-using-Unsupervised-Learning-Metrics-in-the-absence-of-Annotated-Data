moreover , clock gene expression is induced in breast tissue from patients with breast cancer ; this expression is associated with hypomethylation of clock gene. the frequency analysis of 1,538 breast cancer cases and 1,605 controls in china for clock gene variants showed the strong associations between three snps in circadian clock genes and the risk of developing breast cancer. likewise , genotyping in the japanese population identified clock gene polymorphism rs1801260 associated with higher odds ratio ( or ; 1.5 ) of type 2 diabetes ; in contrast , a multicenter study detected the clock polymorphism rs4580704 is associated with prevention of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. similarly , an incremented risk is associated with breast cancer in women from france when they have the allele rs11932595 in clock gene ( or = 0.74 ) or in connecticut ( usa ) when they have the polymorphisms rs7698022 ( or 1.34 ) and rs1048004 ( or , 1.43 ). the silencing of clock gene lowered when women carry polymorphisms associated with cancer such as rs10448004 and rs7698022 , which suggests that clock gene is a critical protagonist of cancer development. the circadian system organizes the different biological functions in 24 h , such as sleep / activity , temperature , heart rate , glucose level , cortisol production , and oxidative stress. in mammals ,.
