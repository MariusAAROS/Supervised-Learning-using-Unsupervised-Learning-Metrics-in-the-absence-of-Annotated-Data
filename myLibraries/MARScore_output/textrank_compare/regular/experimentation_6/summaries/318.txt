however , the rate of imf increase in grain fed cattle is faster than that in pasture fed cattle ( smith et al. , 2009 ). as intramuscular fat ( imf ) improves beef quality at least in juiciness and flavor ( hornsterin and wasserman , 1987 ; wheeler et al. , 1994 ). high quality marbled beef not only has excellent eating quality , but also contains a lot of beneficial fatty acids ( troy et al. , 2016 ). highly marbled wagyu loin contains more than 40% of imf , sometimes more than 60% ( horii et al. , 2009 ) , while quality grade 1 hanwoo , the highest quality grade , has approximately 28% of imf in longissimus thoracis muscle ( hwang and joo , 2016 ). numerous studies have investigated the meat quality , quantity , and muscle physiology of crossbreed wagyu ( japanese black cattle ) in foreign countries ( cafe et al. , 2006 ; cafe et al. , 2009 ; greenwood et al. , 2006 ; greenwood et al. , 2009 ; may et al. , 1993 ). especially , hanwoo beef has relatively thin muscle fiber and minimal content of connective tissues ( kim et al. , 1994 ). it has less subcutaneous fat depth with greater ossification scores and marbling scores than those of australian angus ( cho et al. , 2005 ).
