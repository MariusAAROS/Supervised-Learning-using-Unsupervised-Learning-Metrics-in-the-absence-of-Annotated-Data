the cultured cells were treated with 1 or 10 g / ml of recombinant human adiponectin ( biovendor , usa ) alone or in combination with insulin ( granulosa and theca interna cells ; 10 ng / ml ; sigma , usa ) , fsh ( granulosa cells ; 10 ng / ml ; nhpp , usa ) and lh ( theca interna cells ; 10 ng / ml ; nhpp , usa ) , and combination of those treatments ( insulin + fsh for granulosa cells and insulin + lh for theca interna cells ). following incubation , the media were harvested , centrifuged ( 800 g for 10 min ) , and the supernatants were collected and stored at 20c until analyses of progesterone ( cultures of luteal , theca interna , and granulosa cells ) , oestradiol ( cultures of theca interna and granulosa cells ) , androstenedione , and testosterone ( cultures of theca interna cells ). no significant differences were noted in adiponectin gene expression in granulosa cells compared with theca interna cells and cls ( figure 1(a ) ). in addition to porcine ovarian structures , adiponectin gene expression and the presence of the hormone protein were also found in woman theca interna cells and in theca interna cells , granulosa cells , corpora lutea , and oocytes of rats and cows [ 18 , 19 ]. the expression of adiponectin and its both receptors was lower in granulosa cells than in theca interna cells and oocytes. throughout follicular development , adiponectin mrna increased in granulosa cells and decreased in theca interna cells of cows. induced progesterone production increased in granulosa cells and decreased in theca interna cells.
