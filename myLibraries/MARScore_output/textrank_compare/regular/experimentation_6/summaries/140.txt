sensitive skin is a common term used by patients and clinicians , as well as the cosmetic industry , and represents a complex clinical challenge faced by dermatologists and other skin care professionals. patients with sensitive skin often present with subjective complaints that are out of proportion to the objective clinical findings. some of the contradictions between investigators could be explained by flawed methodologies since the scientific community has yet to identify an acceptable objective screening test for sensitive skin. in a large epidemiological study in the uk (. n = 2316 ) , a staggering 51.4% of women and 38.2% of men self reported themselves as having sensitive skin. this finding validates the link between self perception of sensitive skin and neurosensory discomfort. females were significantly more concerned about sensitive skin than men ; however , no age or ethnic differences were found. the european study , once again , demonstrated that people who reported having sensitive skin were significantly more likely to experience sss symptoms.
