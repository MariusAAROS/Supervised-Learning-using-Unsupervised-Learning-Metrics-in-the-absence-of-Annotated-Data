our patient had typical symptoms of acute bowel edema , including diffuse abdominal pain , occasionally rebound tenderness and vomiting , with spontaneous resolution within 15 days.1,2 some patients with aae have cutaneous or upper respiratory edema in addition , or instead of , bowel symptoms. approximately 145 cases have been reported of aae,3 and this is one of four cases that we have diagnosed in the last decade with abdominal pains from aae with associated cll. table 1 shows characteristics of patients with cll and aae we have seen ( some briefly mentioned in a prior report).4 this is our only case to undergo surgery , allowing unique and dramatic demonstration of massive bowel edema visible radiographically , on surgical inspection and on histopathology. just as with hereditary angioedema ( hereditary c1inh deficiency ; hae ) , common clinical manifestations are skin swelling , laryngeal edema , and/or abdominal pain.1,2 aae often occurs in the context of lymphoplasmacytic disorders , such as monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance ( mgus ) , non hodgkin s lymphoma , or chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( cll).1,3 among 32 patients with aae , castelli found that 13 ( 40% ) had mgus and 9 ( 28% ) had lymphoproliferative disease.3 therefore , all cases of aae should be evaluated for the possibility of underlying lymphoplasmacytic disorder. acquired angioedema ( aae ) , an acquired deficiency of c1esterase inhibitor , is a medically treatable condition which can cause severe abdominal pain mimicking an acute surgical abdomen. this disorder is strongly associated with chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( cll ) and other indolent lymphoplasmacytic disorders. we describe a patient with known cll who developed incapacitating , recurrent severe abdominal pains , culminating in partial bowel resection. wider appreciation of the possibility of aae , particularly in patients with lymphoproliferative disorders , could lead to preventive therapy and spare unnecessary surgery.
