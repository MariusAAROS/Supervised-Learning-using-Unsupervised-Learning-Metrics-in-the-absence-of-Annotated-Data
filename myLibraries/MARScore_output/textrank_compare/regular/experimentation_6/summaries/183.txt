however , others claim that patients with crohn 's disease should be followed for 10 years , and if disease free by then are considered cured. isolated involvement of the appendix in crohn 's disease is reported to be 0.2% to 1.8% , and is usually associated with ileocaecal crohn 's disease in 25% of ileal and 50% of caecal disease. the histology was reported as inflammatory bowel disease ( ibd ) consistent with crohn 's disease ( fig. differential diagnosis includes the presence of foreign bodies and diverticulitis of the appendix , which also give rise to chronic granulomatous inflammation with induration and fibrosis of the appendiceal wall , and granulomatous disease of unknown aetiology such as appendiceal sarcoidosis , which is rare and often accompanies systemic disease. while appendicitis in a patient who was previously diagnosed to have ileocaecal crohn 's may be managed with appendicectomy and ileocaecal resection , appendicectomy alone when performed for appendicitis in a patient with unsuspected ileocaecal crohn 's disease could lead to postoperative complications including enterocutaneous fistula. a young female patient who underwent appendicectomy elsewhere for acute appendicitis presented to us with a persistent enterocutaneous fistula of 6 weeks duration. she had complained of general ill health and occasional altered bowel habits for 6 months prior to the acute appendicitis presentation.
