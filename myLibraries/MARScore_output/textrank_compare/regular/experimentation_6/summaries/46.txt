national recommendations dictate that hospital patients colonized with mrsa should be isolated in single rooms and expert opinion would surmise that there is an increased risk of spread from mrsa colonized catheterized patients due to increased interventions and manipulations required from staff ( e.g. changing catheter drainage devices ). bacteremia itself is associated with bacteriuria in patients infected with sa , which suggests that bacteremia is an important precursor for bacteriuria in some patient groups. patients who cultured an mrsa bacterium were older than patients with mssa , and this was statistically significant ( 53 vs 73 years , p 0.001 ). regarding the clinical stance of patients within the cohort , 9 patients ( 7% ) with mrsa positive urine cultures had a documented history of mrsa bacteremia at that time. there was a statistically significant association between nitrofurantoin resistance and younger patients , in that 75% of patients with nitrofurantoin resistance were younger than 70 years ( p = 0.025 ). despite available publications and guidelines on the management of mrsa skin colonized patients ,. little has been published on the colonization of urine from patients with indwelling urinary catheters.
