the compression and impaction extends to the lateral side of radial neck upon radial neck fracture. we performed a closed reduction with a percutaneous leverage technique and internal fixation method with k wires to treat angulated radial neck fractures in children. from january 2011 to april 2013 , we treated 16 cases of angulated radial neck fractures in 12 boys and 4 girls. we recommend the percutaneous leverage technique during closed reduction and internal fixation using k wires for the treatment of angulated radial neck fractures in children. ( a ) the preoperative x ray showed the severe tilt and displacement of radial neck. the types of fractures categorized by the obrien classification as follows : type most authors agree that fractures with slight angulation should be treated conservatively , but severely angulated fractures ( > 60 ) require further treatment with different methods.
