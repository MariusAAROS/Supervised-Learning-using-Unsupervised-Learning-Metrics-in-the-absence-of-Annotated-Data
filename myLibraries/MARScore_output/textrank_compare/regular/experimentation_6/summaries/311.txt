the von mises stress was measured in the interface of implant bone , implant / abutment complex , and at the bone of the peri implant area in all models. stress on the implant / abutment complex was lower than that in the implant bone interface or peri implant bones. as an alternative to bone graft on a severely atrophied maxillary posterior area , single wide implant or splinting of multiple implants can be performed.2123 the results from the this study showed that , multiple implants , even with a short length and narrow diameter , offer a favorable implant bone interface , peri implant bone , and implant abutment complex. when axial loading or oblique loading was applied , the highest level of stress was observed on the implant bone interface and peri implant bones in a single rp implant and the lowest stress distribution was exhibited in 2si conditions. differences in stress distribution based on implant diameter , number , or position could be observed , but no differences related to types of bone levels were observed ( flat bone vs. stepped bone ) however , these procedures have a number of disadvantages , such as the invasiveness of the surgery , high cost , and long treatment duration after bone graft and implant installation.6 in addition , because bone resorption occurs after a bone graft , the increase in vertical height is unpredictable.. microscopic studies by wallace et al.7 suggested that it was difficult to obtain bones with optimal strength from a bone graft. the maxillary posterior area contains cancellous bones with low bone density and thin cortical bones , the quantity and quality of which are lower than those of the mandibular bone.
