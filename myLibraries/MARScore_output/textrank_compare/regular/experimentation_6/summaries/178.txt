for example , skutch ( 1971 ) noted that nests of this species in costa rica were unlike paper nests in that they persisted for several years. the high durability of p. emaciata construction material suggests that the nest itself may provide greater brood protection than paper nests. breathing in or on p. occidentalis nests always elicited immediate attack responses , therefore , habituation to tapping and breathing stimuli was not evident over the course of the study in p. occidentalis. , the mud nests did not appear waterlogged until 15 min of rainfall had elapsed , while p. occidentalis nests stopped shedding water and became waterlogged after < 5 min. the nest fell 2 m to the ground , with only minor damage to its envelope , and the nest was still occupied by adult wasps when it was collected within 12 h of falling. comparative and experimental studies suggest that , among other functions , nest envelopes reduce rates of predation and parasitism on wasp brood ( london and jeanne , 1998 ; smith et al. , 2001 ). however , little is known about the adaptive significance of variation in the materials that wasps use to construct nest envelopes ( hansell 1984 ; wenzel , 1991 ; cole et al. , 2001 ). our observations suggest that p. emaciata mud nests were more water repellent , and more resistant to mechanical damage , than similarly sized paper nests.
