the national surgical adjuvant breast and bowel project ( nsabp ) b04 randomised study compared breast cancer patients with clinically negative alns managed either by radical mastectomy , total mastectomy with axillary radiation , or total mastectomy alone. , most breast surgeons will hardly ever take the risk of avoiding completion axillary dissection in breast cancer patients even with minimal sentinel lymph node metastases.. takei et al. confirmed the importance of calnd in sln positive patients with high nuclear grade and hormone negative breast cancer. amaros investigates the benefit of a calnd in comparison to treatment with axillary radiotherapy ( art ) in patients with sln positive breast cancer. several mathematical models have been developed to predict the risk of non sln involvement in patients with sln positive breast cancer. recent studies aiming to determine if calnd is beneficial in patients with sln positive breast cancer and even more in patients with minimal sln involvement have reached contrary conclusions. the combination of the introduction of population based mammographic screening for breast cancer , modern imaging methods , and increased public awareness resulted in patients being diagnosed more often with smaller size tumours and less likelihood of axillary lymph node metastases.
