both the piperonylic acid moiety of aa1 ( figure 1 ) and aa1methyl ester showed no activity against bacteria ( table 2 ) , which suggests that the coexistence of phenanthrene ring and free carboxylic acid is essential for aa1 antibacterial activity. the chloroform soluble fraction was therefore selected for further chromatographic separations and resulted in the isolation of known compound aa1 ( figure 1 ). organic solvent extracts of the plant showed antibacterial activities while the water extract showed antifungal activity. this has led to the search for new and effective therapeutic alternatives among natural compounds. moraxella catarrhalis is a gram negative , aerobic diplococcus human mucosal pathogen which causes middle ear infections in infants and children [ 13 ] , and it is one of the three major causes of otitis media along with streptococcus pneumonia and haemophilus influenzae. although moraxella catarrhalis is frequently found as a commensal of the upper respiratory tract , recently it has emerged as a genuine pathogen and is now considered an important cause of upper respiratory tract infections in healthy children and elderly people , lower respiratory tract infections in adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [ 1 , 5 ] , and hospital acquired pneumonia. amikacin , cefixime , fosfomycin , cefuroxime , cotrimoxazole , doxycycline , and erythromycin resistant strains of moraxella catarrhalis were isolated and the widespread production of a 1actamase enzyme renders the bacterium resistant to the penicillin [ 79 ].
