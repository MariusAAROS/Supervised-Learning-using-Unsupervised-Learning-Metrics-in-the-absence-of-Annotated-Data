the rupture of the myocardium occurs rarely in clinical practice ; it is most often associated with myocardial infarction or cardiac surgery , such as mitral valve replacement ( mvr ) , and is usually fatal [ 24 ]. the cause of lv pseudoaneurysm in our patient was a late term complication of mvr. echocardiography revealed normal function of the mitral valve prosthesis ; therefore , mitral reoperation was not indicated. , we have reported a case of lv pseudoaneurysm that occurred as a late complication after mvr. other causes of complete or incomplete rupture of the lv free wall include an oversized prosthetic valve , excessive extirpation of calcium in the mitral annulus , myocardial erosion caused by the struts of the prosthetic valve , the untethering of the fibrous structures of the left ventricle during resection of mitral leaflets , an increase in lv contractility after aortic cross clamping , enhanced lv wall stress with the support of inotropic agents , and other mechanical trauma between the free wall and the papillary muscles , such as rubber catheter wedging or metal pump suction during valve replacement. while a true aneurysm has nonrestrictive continuity with the lv cavity , a pseudoaneurysm has a defect in the myocardial continuity and a well defined neck , representing a history of lv wall perforation. a 55year old woman visited the emergency clinic of hanyang university seoul hospital with chest pain that had persisted for one month and had become aggravated two days earlier. ten years before this admission , the patient had undergone double valve replacement with aortic and mitral mechanical valves due to aortic regurgitation and mitral steno insufficiency.
