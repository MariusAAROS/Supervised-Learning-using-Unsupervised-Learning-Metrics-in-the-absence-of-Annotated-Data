inclusion criteria for this study was defined as : ( i ) acute , isolated , non comminuted and comminuted fractures of the lateral clavicle , ( ii ) complete disruption of both coracoclavicular ligaments , confirmed on radiographs and at surgery , ( iii ) absence of concomitant or pre existing subacromial pathology ( rotator cuff tears , acromial undersurface degeneration ) , ( iv ) surgical treatment with either a joint spanning implant alone ( group 1 ) , or combination of a joint sparing implant and coracoclavicular fixation with either endobutton device , suture anchor , or coracoid cerclage ( group 2 ) surgical treatment of an unstable distal clavicle fracture with a joint spanning implant ( group 1 ). ( hk : hook plate , cl : clavicle , m : medial fragment , l : lateral fragment , arrow : fracture line , ac : acromion , h : humeral head , co : coracoid process ) surgical treatment of an unstable distal clavicle fracture with a joint sparing implant and coracoclavicular ligament reconstruction using endobutton device ( group 2 ). ten patients were operated using a joint spanning implant ( group 1 ) and 5 were operated using a joint sparing implant technique ( group 2 ). overall and group.specific clinico.radiological outcomes and fracture patterns clinical outcomes : the mean cs was marginally higher in group 2 , while the mean sst score was marginally higher in group 1 ; none of these differences were statistically significant. acromioclavicular joint signs were positive in half of the group 1 patients , and in none in group 2 ; however , the walch scores for the acromioclavicular joint were not significantly different for the two groups. return to pre operative level of recreational and competitive sports was seen in approximately two thirds of the patients of group 1 , and all patients of group 2 ; this difference was not found to be statistically significant.
