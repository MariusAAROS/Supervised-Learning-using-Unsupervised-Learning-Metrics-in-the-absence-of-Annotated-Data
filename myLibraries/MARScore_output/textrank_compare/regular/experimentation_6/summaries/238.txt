it must be stressed here that the progenitors of mosaic genes are assumed based purely on the order in which they were discovered and we can not be sure of the directionality of mosaic gene formation. thermophilum b0256pig faecesam71060532the number given in square brackets indicates the instances of that mosaic gene variant reported , if more than one.fourteen of the 15 tet(o / w)1 variants were only determined by pcr analysis and so could be either tet(o. / w)2.eleven of the 28 tet(o / w / o)2 variants were only determined by pcr analysis and so could be either tet(o / w / o)2 or tet(o / w / o)1.all s. suis isolates , but not the same strain.. table 2.sequence identity matrix showing the percentage nucleotide identity between representatives of all 12 rpp gene classes , in descending order , compared with tet(m)rpp genetet(m)tet(s)tet(o)tet(44)tet(32)tet(w)tet(t)tet(36)tet(q)tetb(p)otr(a)tettet(m)1007875706964574946231111tet(s)10070696762565648111110tet(o)100696965564948151211tet(44)1007164505846151110tet(32)10067554947111210tet(w)10012451551412tet(t)10057561882tet(36)1006491111tet(q)100131212tetb(p)10011otr(a)10063tet100accession numbers of representative genes included in the matrix : tet(m ) , u09422 ; tet(o ) , y07780 ; tetb(p ) , ae001437 ; tet(q ) , x58717 ; tet(s ) , x92946 ; tet(t ) , l42544 ; tet(w ) , aj222769 ; tet(32 ) , dq647324 ; tet(36 ) , aj514254 ; tet(44 ) , fn594949 ; otr(a ) , x53401 ; tet , al939106.shaded boxes represent those genes currently reported to comprise mosaic genes.. taking into account these newly defined genes , the total number of mosaic genes reported increases from 30 to 35 ( not including those identified via pcr amplification only ; table 1 ) and suggests that other generically labelled tetracycline resistance genes present in the database [ e.g. those labelled as tet(m)like ] could be further classified , helping to understand mosaic gene proliferation and diversity. different regions ( figure 1 ) , with tet(o ) , tet(w ) and tet(32 ) being the predominant rpp genes reported to form mosaic genes , comprising all but two of the reported variants , and tet(m ) and tet(s ) forming the remaining two. given the prevalence of tet(m ) in certain samples , and the previous reports of self recombination , it is surprising that there are so few reports of mosaic genes containing tet(m ). however , mosaic genes comprising tet(m ) and any other gene , with the exception of tet(s ) , have yet to be reported. therefore , the prevalence of certain mosaic gene variants could suggest that they are in some way more beneficial to the host than the non mosaic genes they comprise..
