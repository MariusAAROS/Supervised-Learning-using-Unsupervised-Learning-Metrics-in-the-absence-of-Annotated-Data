studies have suggested that the final uncorrected visual acuity after excimer laser or corneal inlay surgery is lower in pseudophakic patients than in typical refractive patients. as the first wave of refractive patients begins to require cataract surgery , we may be required to change not only the assessment and technique of cataract surgery for these patients , but also how we counsel these patients who have high expectations for visual acuity and spectacle independence. similar studies done in phakic patients suggest that the improved uncorrected near vision is achieved for at least 1 to 5 years after corneal inlay implantation. while again the majority of studies only include phakic patients , one chinese study reported that ck improved unva up to one year later in presbyopic pseudophakic patients with monofocal iols. the term presbyopia derives from greek for old eyes and refers to the age related loss of natural accommodation and resulting reduction of baseline near vision around the age of 40 years. as people continue to work and stay active later in life than ever before , their need for quality vision at both near and distance vision is also growing. in fact , the presbyopic population worldwide is predicted to rise to 1.4 billion by 2020 and to 1.8 billion by 2050.
