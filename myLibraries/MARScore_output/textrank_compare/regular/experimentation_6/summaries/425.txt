segments 7 and 9 formed 5 independent clusters , segment 12 formed 3 clusters , and the remaining segments formed 4 clusters. two other strains ( 02vn018b and 02vn178b ) were phylogenetically close to chinese bavs when 2 shorter segments , segments 11 and 12 , were analyzed but not when the remaining 10 , longer segments were considered. 50%70% are diagnosed as japanese encephalitis , while the rest of them remain idiopathic ( p.t. nga et al. , unpub. data ). otsu , japan ) with bav targeting primers ( for segment 5 , 5cagctgcagtggttattgga3 and 5accgtgcatcttaacccttg3 ; for segment 8 , 5ttgcagtcgctgagctttta3 and 5cgcatttgatcgtatgcttg3 ). phylogenetic trees for some representative segments ( segments 2 , 6 , 9 , and 12 ) are shown in figure 2. javanese strains formed a single cluster for segments 1 , 2 , 6 , 8 , 10 , and 12. for segments 7 , 9 , and 11 , however , they diverged into 2 clusters , i and ii ( figure 2 , panel c ).
