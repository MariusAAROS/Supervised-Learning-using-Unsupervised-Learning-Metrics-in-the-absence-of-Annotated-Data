mutation in the hnf1 gene causes steatosis,22 therefore most cases of h hca also show marked steatosis.7,11 a correlation study between genotype and phenotype of each subtype revealed a strong association between h hca and the presence of steatosis , the absence of cytological atypia , and absence of inflammatory infiltrate.6 however , one of our l fabp negative cases was not consistent with the description in the new classificat ion system because it did not have steatosis but did have cytological atypia. however , l fabp or saa staining alone seemed to be sufficient for discriminating between h hca and inflammatory hca , respectively. although a lack of steatosis in an l fabp negative case is unusual , similar l fabp negative cases without steatosis can be found in other reports.6,23 according to zucman rossi et al.,6 fewer than 7% of hnf1mutated adenomas show no or < 10% steatosis and fewer than 2% present with cytological atypia. the histologic characteristics of h hca are marked steatosis and an absence of cytological abnormalities and inflammatory infiltrate.6,7,13 this subtype shows negative staining for l fabp because hnf1 positively regulates fabp1 in normal liver tissue. the presence of steatosis and negative l fabp immunostaining were indicators of h hca. the histologic characteristics of h hca are marked steatosis and an absence of cytological abnormalities and inflammatory infiltrate.6,7,13 this subtype shows negative staining for l fabp because hnf1 positively regulates fabp1 in normal liver tissue. the presence of steatosis and negative l fabp immunostaining were indicators of h hca.
