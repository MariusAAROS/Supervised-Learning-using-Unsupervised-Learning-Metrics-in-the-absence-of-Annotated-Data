the finding that women had significantly lower levels of agrp in the whole study group ( 12.535.65 vs. 17.808.66 pg / ml , p = 0.009 ) and in the control group ( 12.905.77 vs. 17.777.14 pg / ml , p = 0.04 ) , but not in the clozapine group ( 12.175.75 vs. 17.8210.28 pg / ml , p = 0.057 ) , might indicate that the testes are important source of agrp , as shown previously ( shutter et al. pg / ml , t = 1.80 , p = 0.04 ). compared with asip , agrp is physiologically expressed in the hypothalamus ( shutter et al. agrp is also expressed in the adrenal gland , testes , kidneys , and lungs. metabolic syndrome and abdominal obesity were defined according to international diabetes foundation ( idf ) criteria ( alberti et al. kg / m , 2530 kg / m and 30 kg / m were defined as normal weight , overweight and obesity , respectively. efficacy of clozapine against positive symptoms of schizophrenia was confirmed in numerous studies and meta analyses ( chakos et al. 2001 ) , including analysis published by the cochrane library ( asenjo lobos et al. activity of arc is also regulated by several hormones of anorexigenic properties : leptin , pancreatic polypeptide ( pp ) , cholecystokinin ( cck ) , glucagon like peptide1 ( glp1 ) , oxyntomodulin ( oxm ) , peptide yy ( pyy ) and the first discovered orexigenic substance ghrelin ( druce et al. 2004 ). the adiposity signals ( insulin and leptin ) are secreted in proportion to body fat content and act in the hypothalamus to inhibit anabolic and stimulate catabolic , effector pathways ( schwartz et al.
