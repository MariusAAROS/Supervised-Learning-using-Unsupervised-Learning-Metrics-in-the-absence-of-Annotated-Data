b : representative dot plot showing the gating strategy for mzb , fob , and t2mzp b cells gated on cd19 b cells. b : representative dot plot showing the gating strategy for mzb , fob , and t2mzp b cells gated on cd19 b cells. b cells infiltrate the islets of young nod mice , the commonly used mouse model for human t1d , and play a role in the initiation of cell destruction by the autoimmune response ( 5 ). clinical trials have identified b cells as a possible therapeutic target for the prevention and reversal of t1d. moreover , studies have shown that b cells are important in regulating both innate and adaptive immunity ( 12 ). a subset of b cells expressing cd19cd5cd1d , which have a regulatory function in infection , inflammation , and autoimmune disease , recently has been identified. correlation between circulating b cell subset frequencies and anthropometric and metabolic variables and islet autoantibodies correlation analyses between circulating b cell subset frequencies ( after log transformation ) and anthropometric and metabolic variables were performed using pearson test.
