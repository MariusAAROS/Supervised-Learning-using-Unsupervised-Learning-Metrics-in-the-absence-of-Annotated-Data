a number of studies have demonstrated that oct is able to identify rnfl loss in eyes with band atrophy of the optic nerve.6,7 the degree of rnfl thickness reduction has been shown to correlate with that of visual field defects using goldmann perimetry4 and automated static perimetry.14,15 this fact gives oct prognostic value regarding the visual outcome , as demonstrated in different studies.16,17 oct is a useful tool to assess the structural and functional damage of ganglion cells , objectively and quantitatively.4 in our case the sd oct demonstrates a symmetrical loss of the rnfl and the ganglion cell layer in both eyes , indicating important optic nerve damage. spectral domain optical coherence tomography ( sd oct ) is able to identify retinal nerve fiber layer ( rnfl ) and ganglion cell loss in the retina. optical coherence tomography ( oct ) is able to identify retinal nerve fiber layer ( rnfl ) and ganglion cell loss in retina.6,7 we present a case in which the oct ( 3d oct2000 spectral domain oct , topcon corporation , tokyo , japan ) was used to diagnose an asymptomatic pituitary macroadenoma. in patients with long standing compression of the optic chiasm , ganglion cells may undergo axonal degeneration. sd oct is a useful tool to assess the structural and functional damage of ganglion cells. pituitary adenoma is the most common cause of the chiasmal syndrome.1 the tumor is classified based on size as microadenoma , smaller than 10 mm , or as macroadenoma when it exceeds 10 mm in diameter.2 some tumors secrete one or more hormones in excess , so called secretory pituitary adenomas , but most are clinically inactive.3 classically , the nonsecretory tumors present with vision loss,4 whereas patients with secretory tumors are usually referred to ophthalmologists for evaluation due to hormonal imbalances that affect bodily functions.5 in patients with long standing compression of the optic chiasm , ganglion cells may undergo axonal degeneration4. the sd oct demonstrated a symmetrical loss of the rnfl and the ganglion cell layer in both eyes , indicating important optic nerve damage.
