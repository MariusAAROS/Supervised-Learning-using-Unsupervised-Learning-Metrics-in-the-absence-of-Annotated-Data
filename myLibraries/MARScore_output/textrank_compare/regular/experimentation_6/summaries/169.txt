in this perspective , the ubiquity of small world structure in real world networks is quite astonishing : within human brains ( sporns and zwi , 2004 ; stam , 2004 ; eguluz et al. bartolomei et al. , 2006 ; micheloyannis et al. , 2006 ; ponten et al. , 2007 ; rubinov et al. , 2009a ; bassett et al. , 2010 ) , as well as between them : networks of scientific co authorship ( newman , 2001 ) , collaborating movie actors ( watts and strogatz , 1998 ; amaral et al. , 2000 ) , social networks in general ( wasserman and faust , 1994 ). the loss of local clustering in our model is in accordance with observations in schizophrenic patients by micheloyannis et al. et al. recently , graph theory is being applied to brain connectivity ( sporns and zwi , 2004 ; bullmore and sporns , 2009 ) and its pathologies in alzheimer 's disease ( stam , 2004 ; stam et al. , 2007 ) , brain tumors ( bartolomei et al. , 2006 ) , epilepsy ( ponten et al. , 2007 ) and , in particular , schizophrenia ( bleuler , 1911/1950 ; friston and frith , 1995 ; andreasen , 1999 ; micheloyannis et al. , 2006 ;. it is possible , in principle , to measure the percolation function in living neural tissue , by using progressive lesioning , for instance through the administration of inhibitory neurotransmitters ( breskin et al. ,. andreasen ( 1999 ) and friston and frith ( 1995 ) considered schizophrenia as fragmentation , understood as the breakdown of integration between widely distributed brain areas ( stephan et al. , 2006 , 2009 ). this breakdown can be associated with the loss of connectivity ( zalesky et al. , 2011 ) , in particular of input to layer 3 pyramidal cells , an effect which is well documented ( e.g. , garey et al. ( 2006 ) , the clinical group also showed longer path lengths than the controls , whereas in rubinov et al.
