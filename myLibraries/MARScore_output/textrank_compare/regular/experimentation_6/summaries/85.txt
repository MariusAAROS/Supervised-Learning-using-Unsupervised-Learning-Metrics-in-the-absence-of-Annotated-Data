however , biomarker comparisons have suggested that self reported measures have low validity ( cowan et al. , 2002 ; gavin et al. , 2006 ; mensch , hewett , gregory , & helleringer , 2008 ; palen et al. , 2008 ; plummer et al. , 2004 ). higher prevalence estimates are associated with certain regions ( e.g. , eastern and southern africa ) and subpopulations ( e.g. , adolescent orphaned and/or married girls ; birdthistle et al. , 2008 ; operario , underhill , chuong , & cluver , 2011 ; pascoe et al. , 2010 ). however , very few adolescent prevention studies have used biomarker data as outcomes ( michielsen et al. , 2010 ) because of concerns about the difficulties in collecting these data in resource poor settings ( jukes , simmons , & bundy , 2008 ) , even when power analyses suggest that moderate intervention effects could be detected. moreover , these adolescents are rarely tested for hiv in clinical settings unless they present in poor health or with recurrent infections ( ferrand et al. , 2009 ). most adolescent hiv prevention studies have relied on changes in self reported sexual behavior to assess intervention effectiveness ( see reviews : cowan & pettifor , 2009 ; michielsen et al. ,. 2010 ) , with audio computer assisted self interviews intended to improve veracity ( mensch , erulkar , & hewett , 2003 ). hiv infection is not the most useful biomarker of adolescent sexual activity by itself because of the relatively low prevalence among younger adolescents and the potential for transmission through perinatal and non sexual blood borne routes ( amornkul et al. , 2009 ; ferrand et al. , 2009 ; stover , walker , grassly , & marston , 2006 ). herpes simplex virus type 2 ( hsv2 ) , the primary cause of genital herpes , is a commonly used biomarker of sexual activity because the presence of hsv2 antibodies is highly associated with past sexual behavior ( tobian et al. , 2009 ; van de laar et al. , 1998 ).
