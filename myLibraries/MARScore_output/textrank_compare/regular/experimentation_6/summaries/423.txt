reagents were purchased from the following sources : l tyrosine , phosphate buffer solution ( pb , ph 6.5 ) and catalase ( from bovine liver ) from wako pure chemicals ( osaka , japan ) ; tyrosinase ( from mushroom ) , and superoxide dismutase ( sod from bovine erythrocytes ) from sigma aldrich corp. reagents were purchased from the following sources : l tyrosine , phosphate buffer solution ( pb , ph 6.5 ) and catalase ( from bovine liver ) from wako pure chemicals ( osaka , japan ) ; tyrosinase ( from mushroom ) , and superoxide dismutase ( sod from bovine erythrocytes ) from sigma aldrich corp. immediately after mixing the mixture was transferred to an esr spectrometry cell , and the esr measurement was started after 60 s. as a control , the reaction mixture was prepared to contain 100 l of h2o ( ultrapure water ) , 20 l of 10 u/l tyrosinase dissolved in h2o , 20 l of 4.5 m dmpo dissolved in h2o , and 60 l of 1 mm tyrosine dissolved in h2o , and was similarly subjected to esr measurement. immediately after mixing the mixture was transferred to an esr spectrometry cell , and the esr measurement was started after 60 s. as a control , the reaction mixture was prepared to contain 100 l of h2o ( ultrapure water ) , 20 l of 10 u/l tyrosinase dissolved in h2o , 20 l of 4.5 m dmpo dissolved in h2o , and 60 l of 1 mm tyrosine dissolved in h2o , and was similarly subjected to esr measurement. representative esr spectra obtained from tyrosine tyrosinase reaction with different activity of tyrosinase are summarized in fig. the proposed mechanism by which h and oh are generated in tyrosine tyrosinase reaction is illustrated in fig.. since there are many cosmetics developed for whitening ability by inhibiting tyrosine tyrosinase reaction , our study revealed that they also might contribute to alleviate the oxidative damage of the skin by inhibiting oh generation via the enzyme reaction.
