although several studies worldwide have reported on the epidemiology of feline hemoplasmosis in sick or healthy client owned pet cats with prevalences ranging from 7.2% to 45.8% [ 519 ] and few studies have focused on stray cat ( with prevalences from 11.5% to 60% [ 2024 ] ) , there have been no studies investigating stray cats in northern italy. stray cats in this study had higher rates of infections than those reported for pet cats in northern italy , in which 18.9% of pcr tested cats were reported to be haemoplasma positive. lastly , statistical analysis was limited in some groups because of the sample size and so some conclusions or associations may be affected by type i errors ; that is , no difference between haemoplasma positive and negative groups was observed due to insufficient sample size ; for example , no association was recorded between anaemia and a positive haemoplasma result because of the low number of mhf positive cats ( 28/260 ). the vector potential of ctenocephalides felis has been demonstrated in experimental mhf infections , and stray cats may play a role in multiplying the organism in fleas that then infest pet cats and dogs and human beings. the aim of this study was to evaluate , using a conventional pcr assay , the prevalence of mhf and cmhm infections in stray cats from colonies in milan and to identify possible risk factors for these infections. the prevalence of haemoplasmas in stray cats in our study ( 33.1% ) was higher than that reported in other studies on stray cats performed worldwide ( table 4 ). a high incidence of haemoplasmas in stray cats is not surprising as outdoor access is a recognized risk factor for infection.
