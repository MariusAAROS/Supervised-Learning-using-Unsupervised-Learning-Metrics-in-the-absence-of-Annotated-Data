the present study investigated the expression of selected immunological lineage specific markers and selected vesicle related markers on five major leukocyte subpopulations , namely , cd4 t cells , cd8 t cells , nk cells , b cells , and monocytes. likewise , cd14 , cd16 , cd56 , and cd3 could not be detected on sevs from cultured monocytes , nk cells , and t cells , respectively ( figure 1(a ) ). cd9 was detected on all sev subsets , though at very low levels on sevs from t cells and nk cells. cd82 was detected at high levels on sevs from monocytes and pbmcs and at very low levels on sevs from b cells and t cells but was absent on sevs from nk cells. in contrast , cd4 and cd8 , which are lineage markers for two different populations of t cells , were detected on sevs from the supernatants of these two t cell subpopulations. several studies have described the expression of cd16 on a small portion of different types of t cells and even shown a functional role of cd16 on t cells [ 44 , 45 ]. surprisingly , cd41 was observed on sevs from t cells , b cells , monocytes , and pbmcs as well as on plasma sevs from half of the healthy donors ( figure 1(c ) ).
