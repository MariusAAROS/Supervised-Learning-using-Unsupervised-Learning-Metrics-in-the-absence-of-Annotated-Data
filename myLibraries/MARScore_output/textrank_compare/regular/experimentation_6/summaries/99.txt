combining our data on snail monosaccharide analysis , data from previous gc ms methylation analysis and the fragmentation results of lc esi ms / ms analysis of selected snails we could determine the main structures of snail o glycans and classify them according to their modification of the established core structure into six groups : ( i ) glycans smaller than the core , missing one or both methyl groups or missing one hexose ; ( ii ) the trisaccharide core containing galnac and two 4o methylated hexose residues ; ( iii ) the core with additional methylated hexoses ; ( iv ) the core with one or two additional unmethylated hexoses and sometimes one more methylated hexose ; ( v ) glycans containing fucose ; ( vi ) glycans containing one hexnac and up to six unmethylated hexoses. o glycans have been found to play an important role in protein stability and tertiary structure , stabilize protein conformation , modulate the activity of enzymes ( e.g. by reversible attachment of o linked glcnac to cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins ) and signaling molecules , are essential for a number of recognition processes and are sorting determinants guiding the modified protein in the cell from the place of biosynthesis to its target location [ 13 ]. xenopus eggs have o glycans with up to 10 monosaccharide constituents , often highly fucosylated , with a linkage to the protein via galnac [ 11 , 12 ]. even parasites ( helminths and t. cruzi ) display small galnac linked o glycans. o glycans occur as arabinogalactans linked to hydroxyproline or serine ( galhyp / ser ) , or hydroxyproline is glycosylated with short arabinofuranosides ( arahyp , arahyp ). we present for the first time an overview on o glycans of some species of the mollusk branch of the evolutionary tree. the preparation of o glycans was carried out via elimination followed by further separation steps.
