it has been reported that 25%30% of colorectal cancer patients who have no visible metastasis at the time of diagnosis will develop distant metastases within 5 years after primary tumor resection , which in some cases may be related to the effects of the surgery ( van der bij et al. , 2009 ). mechanisms to explain distant metastasis following primary tumor resection include ( 1 ) the presence of residual tumor cells or tissue at the resected site ( ando et al. , 2003 , minsky et al. , 1988 ) ,. ( 2 ) the recruitment of inflammatory cells and platelets to the resected site that promote wound healing and cell proliferation ( ceelen et al. , 2014 , hofer et al. , 1999 , retsky et al. ,. 2012 ) , and ( 3 ) increased local and systemic effects that can induce an angiogenic switch in remote dormant tumors ( bono et al. , 2010 , retsky et al. , 2012 , takemoto et al. , 2012 ). previous studies have revealed that hypoxic tumor cells stimulate angiogenic related factors via hif1 , leading to increased tumor invasion ( paraskeva et al. , 2006 ,. lox is expressed by different cell types , including tumor cells and stromal cells within the tumor microenvironment ( decitre et al. , 1998 ). the host response to anti cancer therapy and its contribution to tumor ( re)growth and metastasis has been evaluated following chemotherapy ( daenen et al. , 2011 , gingis velitski et al. , 2011 ) , radiotherapy ( barcellos hoff et al. , 2005 ,. 2015 ) , and various molecularly targeted drugs ( beyar katz et al. , 2016 ) ( for a review , see shaked , 2016 ). previous clinical studies indicated that both systemic and local angiogenesis are induced in response to surgery when compared to laparoscopy ( bono et al. , 2010 ).
