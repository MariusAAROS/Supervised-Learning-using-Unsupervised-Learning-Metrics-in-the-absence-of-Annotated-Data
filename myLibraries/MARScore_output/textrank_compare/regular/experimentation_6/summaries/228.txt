in parallel to l. major infection in balb / c mice , where the oligoclonal v4 v8 cd4 t cell population is necessary to the development of susceptibility in the host and is considered as pathogenic t cells , in l. amazonensis infection , t cells , in a general way , seem to be highly pathogenic. effective macrophage activation is the key to control the infection ; however , the phenotype displayed by t cells in different situations is not as polarized as observed in the classical model. c il4 receptor knock out ( ko ) mice remained susceptible to l. major infection when infected with lv39 strain , which seems to be due to an increased production of il10 by t cells. first of all , there is no clonal or oligoclonal t cell population involved , since there is no predominance of a single or a group of v chains expressed on t cells that respond to l. amazonensis infection. the mechanisms underlying pathogenic role of t cells for the disease need to be determined. however , these levels are dramatically increased when infected macrophages are in the presence of previously primed t cells or their soluble products. when compared to l. braziliensis parasites , for example , l. amazonensis parasites are much less capable of triggering the expression of cd40 and cd80 , both costimulatory molecules for t cell activation , and the production of il12p40.
