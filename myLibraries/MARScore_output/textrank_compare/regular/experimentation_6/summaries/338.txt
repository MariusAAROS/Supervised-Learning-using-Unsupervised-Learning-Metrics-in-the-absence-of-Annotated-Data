the objectives are as follows : to get students to reflect systematically and critically upon conventional and thus familiar ways of thinking and acting , expectations and beliefs in medicine ; to get students to reflect upon central concepts such as bedarf / bedrfnis ( needs in objective vs. subjective terms ) that are normative in character and have a structuring and guiding effect on medical care services ; to advance and refine students soft skills , including the ability to put themselves in the position of other people , in particular those using medical services ; to employ the method of participant observation in order to gain awareness of patients concrete social and environmental living conditions , in this case people on the fringe of society ; and to raise students awareness of what can be deemed suitable support services for people whose behaviour is not consistent with the conventional expectations of health professionals. to get students to reflect systematically and critically upon conventional and thus familiar ways of thinking and acting , expectations and beliefs in medicine ; to get students to reflect upon central concepts such as bedarf / bedrfnis ( needs in objective vs. subjective terms ) that are normative in character and have a structuring and guiding effect on medical care services ; to advance and refine students soft skills , including the ability to put themselves in the position of other people , in particular those using medical services ; to employ the method of participant observation in order to gain awareness of patients concrete social and environmental living conditions , in this case people on the fringe of society ; and to raise students awareness of what can be deemed suitable support services for people whose behaviour is not consistent with the conventional expectations of health professionals. the new teaching concept was developed on the basis of the following findings and considerations : in the standard degree courses required by the regulations for licensing doctors medical students will get to experience doctor patient interaction almost exclusively in a hospital setting or in doctors surgeries , in other words , in institutional environments which in terms of their organisation and management of internal procedures are driven by the rationality of medical thinking ( in addition to political and economic requirements ). medical students will get to experience doctor patient interaction almost exclusively in a hospital setting or in doctors surgeries , in other words , in institutional environments which in terms of their organisation and management of internal procedures are driven by the rationality of medical thinking ( in addition to political and economic requirements ). bedarf/bedrfnis , terms referring to needs in the perspective of the physician , or the patient respectively : while the use of the term bedarf presupposes ( scientific ) objectivity and is therefore widely employed in the sense of measurable and essentially quantifiable entities in medical and political debates on medical care , the term. bedrfnis is far more closely linked to the subjective perception of an individual or a particular predefined group.empirical research on medical care for people with migratory backgrounds in a number of different health care systems strongly points to the fact that the issues and problems as regards medical or health care services that become apparent with socially marginalised groups are by no means exclusively limited to these. , these problems tend to be phenomena of a ubiquitous nature that apply universally in the context of medical care and doctor / patient interaction , which become strikingly apparent when dealing with socially marginalised groups.
