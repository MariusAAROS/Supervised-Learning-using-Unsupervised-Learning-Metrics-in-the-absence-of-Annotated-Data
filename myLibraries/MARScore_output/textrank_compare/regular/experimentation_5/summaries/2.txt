human chorionic gonadotrophin is thought to play a crucial role in the development of ohss ( rizk et al. two distinct forms of severe ohss have been described : early and late forms ( papanikolaou et al. , 2005 ; mathur et al. , 2000 ). the use of antagonist in the luteal phase with total freeze of embryos to prevent severe ohss has also been suggested ( lainas et al. , 2012 ). ohss is a serious complication of ovulation induction , occurring in 1 10% of in vitro fertilization patients ( rizk and aboulghar , 1991 ; brinsden et al. , 1995 ). this iatrogenic condition has a spectrum of clinical and laboratory manifestations ranging from mild to severe , even life threatening conditions ( rizk et al. , 1990 ). vascular endothelial growth factor is an angiogenic cytokine that is a potent stimulator of the vascular endothelium and appears to play an integral role in follicular growth , corpus luteum function and ovarian angiogenesis ( rizk et al. , 1997 ). vascular endothelial growth factor causes increased capillary permeability with its sequelae of ascites and possible pleural effusion ( rizk et al. , 1997 ; gomez et al. , 2002 ). early ohss is caused by the administration of exogenous human chorionic gonadotrophin ( hcg ) and it starts before the 10th day after oocyte retrieval , while the late form is the result of endogenous human chorionic gonadotrophin release in the event of pregnancy , and it starts after the 10th day following oocyte aspiration ( papanikolaou et al. , 2005 ;.
