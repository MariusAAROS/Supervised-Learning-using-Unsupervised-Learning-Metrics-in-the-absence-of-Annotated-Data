## ✔️ Installation

### Refiner Class

Get the repository locally: 
```sh
  git clone https://github.com/MariusAAROS/Supervised-Learning-using-Unsupervised-Learning-Metrics-in-the-absence-of-Annotated-Data.git
```
Then, go to the repository root. Using a command prompt, execute the following commands: 
```sh
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  python init.py
```
Enter the path where you want the models and various data to be downloaded: 
```sh
  /path/to/your/ressource/folder/
```
Finally, test that the library works correctly: 
```sh
  cd myLibraries
  python refining.py
```
It should take around 2 minutes to compile.
